Courage Versus Secrecy . It is not long only a few months ago - since a question was asked in the House of Commons about a certain pamphlet sold by the N.U.W.S.S. , called " Under the Surface . This question was part of a regular campaign of abuse , which sought to represent the Union as a disseminator of obscene literature . The pamphlet in question was written , in a purely scientific spirit , by a well - known doctor , and was sent out only when specially asked for , or for use at meetings organised for special purposes in connection with moral reform . The advertisement given to it by abuse did indeed send up its circulation with a leap , but those who read it saw for themselves that it was a serious contribution to a terribly serious problem , and the campaign of abuse has died a natural death . Last week , a memorial signed by physicians of the highest standing ( including Dr. Mary Scharlieb ) demanded the appoint- ment of a Royal Commission to investigate the facts . << The time has come when it is a national duty to face the facts , and bring them prominently before the notice of the public . There has always been a conspiracy of silence as regards venereal diseases . ' That is to say , the very task which Suffra- gists have been performing for years , at the cost of such insult and abuse as women are peculiarly sensitive to , is now put forward as a national duty , " by those to whom the world will be compelled to listen . Readers of THE COMMON CAUSE will remember with pride that the International Suffrage Alliance demanded such a Commission of inquiry from all Governments , and that our speakers and writers for years have been doing their utmost to break the " conspiracy of silence " which has been so consistently upheld by our opponents , and is now denounced as a treachery to the race . We rejoice that this demand has been put forward , and we demand that women as well as men , laity as well as doctors , shall be among the mem- bers of the Commission .

In If the Royal Commission be appointed there is some hope that the general public will at length be enlightened with regard to the influence of immorality upon infant mortality . accordance with the usual convention , the recently issued report of the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board does not

Dr. Newscombe has much to say about the mother who does not nurse her infant , and the ill effects upon their children of the work of young married women in factories ; but this report contains only a few stray hints here and there that the mode of life of the father has any influence upon his child's health . AUGUST 1 , 1913 . The scope for women's work with regard to the reduction of the infant death - rate will be dealt with later in an article on Dr. Newscombe's report . Homes for Wronged Children . A letter which appeared in our columns on this subject has excited some incredulity on the part of readers to whom it appears an absolute impossibility that children of tender years should be so terribly wronged as Miss Waring's letter stated . We assure them that Homes not only exist , but are badly needed . We have received notice of St. Mary's Home , Buxted , Sussex , of the Home of the Holy Rood , Worthing , and an appeal from Miss Walkington , who desires to found a Children's Colony " in Ireland , to save children ( " before they are ruined " ) from undesirable surroundings . We protest , by the way , against such an abuse of language as is implied by the word " fallen , " applied to children whose only " fall has been that they are utterly defenceless . It is with astonishment that one sees it in newspapers and even in charitable appeals- not , let us hasten to add , in the three mentioned above . American Women and the Vote . Our attention has been called to a paragraph in the Glasgow Herald of July 25th , in which it is stated that the women of Illinois are not using their votes , and that " in practically every State where the Suffrage prevails , the women are growing tired of their new toy . We have not received figures from Illinois , but the figures from other States encourage us to hope that the alarming but beautifully vague report of the Glasgow Herald may be as mistaken as it is fearful : - WYOMING . Women enfranchised , 1869. Percentage who vote , 80 to 90 . COLORADO . Women enfranchised , 1893. ( Official returns do not give male and female voters separately .

But it was soon found that a special effort must be made to bring the women in , partly because they have , on some questions , rather different interests ; partly because they are hardly accustomed to the idea that education is as much for them as for the men . We rejoice to see that the special courses arranged for them assume that they are as individual in their tastes as men are , and the subjects taken have included Literature , History , Citizenship , Nature Study , and Art , as In the well as Hygiene , Embroidery , and " The Home . " ordinary tutorial classes , " where teaching of a University standard is given , the percentage of women students has risen to 15 , and it is interesting to note that in one case - in Chorley- The class was the women actually outnumbered the men . one on Psychology , and had grown out of a child - study class the year before . A Remarkable Document . a A very interesting document is being circulated among certain Liberal Members of Parliament by the Liberal Anti- Suffragist group . It is a statement of the views of Liberal Leaders opposed to Women's Suffrage , and is accompanied by a leaflet re - arguing ( ? ) the " physical force " objection . A post- card asking for signatures for or against the extension of the franchise to women suggests that a referendum is being taken , but , curiously enough , prominent Suffragist Liberals are not receiving this post - card , and so have no opportunity of recording their vote . The printed opinions of Mr. Asquith and Lord Lore- burn contain statements which appear positively ludicrous on " Liberal " leaflet . The Prime Minister , for instance , relies on the fact that Parliament has been perfectly fair to women . This would be more impressive if it came from a statesman of good government is a party not committed to the belief that " * Lord Loreburn repeats no substitute for self - government . " Mr. Asquith , and is also quoted as holding that it would be a constitutional outrage for the House of Commons to enact Women's Suffrage now . The Prime Minister's repudia- tion of this view in the recent Suffrage debate does not appear . A long list of proofs that government rests on physical force is obligingly cancelled for us by the writer himself , at the end , by the admission that " in the long run , physical force is at the service of moral force , and from the sphere of moral force no woman is excluded . " << The Payment of Maternity Insurance . It is greatly to be hoped that the decision of the Committee on the Insurance Act , that the Maternity Benefit belongs , and should be paid to , the mother , will be upheld on the Report stage of the Bill . It is important not only because the amend- ment will prevent some unnecessary and very cruel hardship , but because it establishes a principle with regard to the wife's position . She has a right to the money , though her husband pays the insurance ; because her work at home is as important economically as his outside , and his wage is , in fact , earned by both together . This fact has been obscured too long . The Letters of Charlotte Bront " . << It would be difficult to imagine in fiction a more moving episode than that given to us in the four hitherto unpublished letters of Charlotte Brontë , which appeared in the Times of July 29th . They have been described as throwing a light on the relations between the writer and M. B. Heger , equally honourable to both . " Certainly there is nothing dishonourable to either , and we shall all be grateful to the public spirit of those who have given these letters to the world . But though not in any ordinary sense " dishonourable , " it must be admitted that the light thrown on the mind of one of the two concerned is a sufficiently repellent one . To have been offered the devoted friendship of a Charlotte Brontë - to have been the only person of intellectual calibre with whom that stormy and heroic soul felt itself sufficiently akin to care for communion - to be offered so much , and to be so blindly , densely unaware of it . It is one of those ironies of existence which seem almost incredibly grotesque . Without Pause - Without Haste . Before the Pilgrimage is well over , the work of the coming month is upon us . First , there are the Suffrage Summer Schools , at Oxford and St. Andrews . The Oxford School is , we understand , already more than full up . That at St. Andrews is larger , and further away in distance from many of our members , and there is still room for a few more students . Details will be found under " Notes from Headquarters . " The other piece of immediate work is the sale of THE COMMON CAUSE . It should be brought before the notice of holiday - makers and others during the summer months , when people have time to read . We announce a Selling Competition on page 295 . THE COMMON CAUSE when ordering goods .

The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies being a body which exists solely to obtain the enfranchisement of women , holds no official view upon any other topic . Opinions expressed upon other subjects must not be regarded as necessarily those of the Union . Forward ! The Pilgrimage is over . It reached its triumphant conclusion in Hyde Park on Saturday , July 26th . Those who went out to meet the Pilgrims pouring in along the great roads felt at once that it was a triumph . Whatever some of them had been through whether they had met with applause and sympathy only , or applause and abuse in turn - they all marched in so gaily and so gallantly , that it seemed that they must take the world by storm . " 99 Do not blame us , " wrote a correspondent a little while we seem too light - hearted on the way . ago , " if w Remember that we have had our rough time too . ' Blame them ! Is it not of the essence of the Pilgrim - spirit , this light - heartedness on the road ? Our Suffragists in their singing , their jests , and their gaiety , have revived the very spirit of S. Francis of Assisi , who called himself and his brethren " Joculatores Dei , " the jesters or troubadours of God . In such a cause , and with such comrades as theirs , they could not be other than gay . Even the hardships made them rejoice . Those who had the rough places count up their dangers with delight . They regret , as we all must , that , here and there , there should have been such bitterness and such senseless brutality ; but they rejoice that , if there must be violence , it was they who had to meet it . Those who found nothing but kindness bring their welcome testimony of sympathy and support , but loudly lament that they had not the luck to be at the post of danger . There is something both moving and inspiring in the spirit of these Pilgrims . It has always been a dangerous business to go forth unarmed to convert the slow - moving apathetic world . But to go now , when so much bitterness has been created , when many people feel that in breaking up a Suffrage meeting , they are only doing what Suffragists have done to them , is an adventure indeed . After all , it is the only adventure worth having ! No wonder the Pilgrims were inspired . Yet we shall not forget that , after all , it was a Pilgrimage . Repent of thy sins in private , " said S. Francis , and appear Because " " not before the community with a downcast face . " the Pilgrims face the world so gaily , they were not therefore the less Pilgrims , dedicated to the repenting of national sins . " Whenever a hooligan throws mud or curses at me , " said one of our speakers on Saturday in Hyde Park , " I always have in my mind a picture of his wife , who has to bear every day what I bear for an hour , of insult and brutality . the platform touched the audience more . Nothing said from And one thought further , not only of that hooligan's wife , but of his children , and of his own childhood . What sort of a chance had he been given when he was a child ? Some people seem by some inscrutable mystery of evil to be born depraved . But these are very few . Most of our criminals are manufactured . We allow babies to be born in surroundings that are foul . We sweat their mothers . We give them in all their lives nothing that is beautiful . And when we want to put a beautiful ideal before them , we are met with the brutality which is the natural result of all this . It is in the Potteries , and in other towns where there is a large and underpaid population , that there has been most hooliganism . And in the heart of every Suffragist there is a depth of pity for those who have never been given a chance . There is a kind of poverty which is ennobling - the poverty which is not grinding or sordid , but only austere and plain . But there is a degree of poverty in which only by a miracle purity

There are conditions of life permitted by our civilised " country which make decency impossible , and the result cannot be resented by us when it comes back in the horse - play of a band of roughs . We Suffragists are deeply conscious that our Pilgrimage has been a needed act of penitence for a great national sin . And we are certain that even where hostility was bitter and violent , the faith in human nature which enabled our Pilgrims to make their appeal to reason and to justice , will in the end create the spirit to which that appeal was made . And elsewhere , and generally , the response has been so fine . All the way through some of our Federations there has been nothing but enthusiasm and perfect understanding . In London , too , not a meeting has been disturbed or hostile . From a few places horrific reports reached the London Society of the recep- tion prepared for the Pilgrims , and they hastened to arrange a meeting to take off the worst of the storm . There was no storm ! Peace reigned everywhere , and the meetings were exhilarating . It is remarkable that in London the very poorest parts seem quite without the element of brutality which we have noticed elsewhere . It is not only from the artisan class , whose sympathy and respect Suffragists have learned to count on , that they get a good reception ; but among the very poorest of the poor , whose courtesy and good wishes for " luck on Saturday afternoon " have followed the speakers wherever they have been . If we have something to pity and forgive , we have much more to admire . The Pilgrimage is over , but its spirit lives on . We are all Pilgrims now , whether we have been on the road or not . We have dedicated ourselves to the service of humanity , and above all to the unfortunate . Our social system , with its cruelties and its injustices , takes from them everything and gives nothing back . It takes from them beauty , and joy , and colour , and all that makes life worth living and virtue possible . We , who are inevitably part of that social system , cannot give back what has been taken away . Some day we hope to set ourselves to Ithe task of reform , and make these horrors impossible . Some day men and women , working side by side in the full conscious- ness of their great responsibility , will be able to give to the citizens of the future a fairer world to live in . But we cannot then give back what we have taken from those who suffer now . They had only one life , and we took that . We also have only one life . Let us give it . << The Knight on Horseback . BY ELIZABETH BANKS ( AUTHOR OF " THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A NEWSPAPER GIRL , " & c . ) . I was beginning to feel a bit nervous when I saw the Knight on Horseback . You see it was this way : I was in charge of a C. C. C. , " which was the short way we had of designating a COMMON CAUSE Car during the Pilgrimage . In my car were a few thousand copies of THE COMMON CAUSE , for distribution to the sellers all along the way . A dozen more ! Twenty - four - oh , no , make it thirty -I can sell them for sixpence each ! Here , I'll help you count - five , six , eight , twelve , seventeen . Got change for a half sovereign ? " No use taking less than four dozen , it's so wearing and tearing to walk all the way back for more ! " THE COMMON CAUSE , COMMON CAUSE ! " << ( C << 93 All day Friday and a good part of Saturday , the pleasant voices of the volunteer sellers kept me company . My white gloves had become a brilliant crimson from the handling of the red - printed covers of the special souvenir number . It kept me on the jump , and I liked it . The Pilgrims were all about me , and while the band played I handed out COMMON CAUSES in time to sprightly airs . I was counting out COMMON CAUSES and placing them in neat heaps of a dozen each , when I missed the voices of the sellers , and heard only faintly a strain of music from a far - away band . C By the turning of a corner , and a sudden holding up of the traffic , I had got separated from the rest of the Pilgrims . " Got any bombs in yer pocket ? " Oi , sy , git ' long !

" These were the voices of hundreds of men , women , and children who lined the pavement , pushing , pushing towards the I cannot say they were really hostile faces , although three or four girls stuck out their tongues at me . Some of the faces were curious , some kindly . There was really nothing to be frightened at , and yet I felt my nerves giving way . What if the more ignorant members of this great crowd should not car .

288 THE COMMON understand that I naa nothing to do with bombs , and burnings , and such ? What if they should surround me , and drag me from the motor ? I felt a heavy breathing and panting behind me , and I looked round . There was a Knight on Horseback , riding directly behind the motor . Keep away from the lady , do you hear ? he said , and the crowd drew away . " " Oh , " I said , I thought I was entirely cut off from the rest of the Pilgrims , and I was stupid enough to be a bit frightened . The crowd is only curious , of course ; but some of them were almost getting into the motor . " " I noticed that , and I've been galloping to get to you , " he replied . " Why , aren't you in the procession ? " I asked . " 66 Well , no , " he said , not precisely . The truth is - the truth is " He hesitated and smiled , and I interrupted with , mean you're a detective in plain clothes . " " " You " No. The truth is , I'm an Anti - Suffragist ! The Knight on Horseback stood by the motor throughout the blocking of the traffic , and then he rode directly behind when He was by my side when I rejoined again we began to move . the Pilgrims , and two hours later he passed me in the Park . << It seems very quiet and peaceable , and I think all you ladies are safe , so I can leave you now , ' he said . " I don't believe in out - door speaking for women ! Don't get separated from the rest of the Pilgrims again ! He was gone the Anti - Suffrage Knight on Horseback , and I haven't seen him since ; but he is one of the pleasant recollec- tions I shall always have of the Pilgrimage . Women in the Administration of the Law . Advantages of an Official Status . At the Congress for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic , of which a report has already appeared in THE COMMON CAUSE , an interesting discussion took place on the assistance which women could give in administrative measures . Commis- sioner Bullock , though believing it was essential that women should co - operate in the work of suppressing the traffic , ex- pressed a doubt as to whether this association would be any more effective if it were official instead of merely voluntary , as it has been in this country hitherto ; and in this idea he was sup- ported by a German delegate , Frau Müller . A Canadian lady , on the other hand , spoke strongly of the advantages of an official status , giving the following as an example of what a recognised police woman can do : - " All the young women leaving a certain store were molested . Police- men six feet high were sent and could do nothing . Two policewomen in little serge dresses and white sailor hats at once put a stop to the whole thing . Every young woman who enters a police court is at once an object of interest to the dealers in vice . They note her address , they speak to her as she comes out . We have women's police courts separate from the men's now , where the men dealers cannot enter . " " The experience of Canada is confirmed by that of the United States , where women police have proved a great success . Power of arrest - even if rarely exercised - has been found to add greatly to the authority and prestige of women engaged in rescue work , and the favourite argument of the Anti - Suffragists - that women cannot help in the protection of the community - has been quite disproved . Strong testimony to their efficiency comes from Mr. Felix O'Neill , Chief of Police in Denver , who states that " the best man of the Denver police force happens to be a woman . This is Miss Josephine Roche , a young girl who was appointed some time ago specially to inspect dancing - halls , skating - rinks , and other places of public amusement in Denver , which had become the resort of people of bad character , male and female , and the hunting ground of agents of the white slave traffic . The bad influence of these places upon the hundreds of children frequenting them , without restraint or protection , led to an ordinance forbidding the entrance of boys and girls under sixteen unless accompanied by their parents . At first this ordinance was deeply resented , but Miss Roche's tactful handling of the situation has won respect for the law . Rejecting the ordinary methods of the male police officer , she aimed not at arresting for breach of the law , but at winning obedience by an appeal to men's better nature . Many a proprietor who started with a fixed determination to evade the regulations had his sense of responsibility aroused , and was converted into a staunch supporter , once he was made to realise the danger to young girls of frequenting public places of amusement without a protector . No less successful was Miss Roche's method of dealing with

Instead of treating them as the youthful hooligans of Denver . enemies , she approached them in a friendly spirit and so won their hearts that it became a favourite game with them to act as Miss Roche's greatest a body - guard when she went her rounds . work , however , has been in dealing with " unfortunates . ' When Mr. George Creel started his great campaign for the abolition of commercialised vice , it was Miss Roche's task not only to work among the victims of this horrible traffic , but to influence public opinion , and convince men and women that com- mercialised vice is not a necessary evil . « Intensely feminine , " writes Mr. Creel in an article in the Metropolitan Magazine , " and possessed of the twin gifts of sympathy and understanding , she bore down all anger and resentment , and fanned hope to flame in many an ash - heaped heart . She swept through the women's clubs like an inspiring spirit , and whenever a group of mothers could be gathered , she talked the new idea at them and into them . " Other American cities are following the lead of Denver . San Francisco has lately appointed two policewomen , whose duty it is to patrol parks and squares . Mrs. Alice Wells is police officer in Los Angeles , her endeavour being to influence the criminally- inclined , and thus prevent crime . Topeka , Kansas , has two women police officers , Miss Elizabeth N. Barr , and Miss Ena Canning , who passed the highest grades in the civil service examinations of that city . They will be engaged in rescue work and the inspection of places of public recreation rather than in Miss Barr writes enthu- dealing with the criminal classes . siastically of the opportunities of her work : - " I'm part Irish . I understand that is one of the requirements of a patrolman , isn't it ? " Seriously , I think we have a chance to do a great deal of good . The idea of helping people , of helping women in trouble , or likely to be in trouble , will be the basis of our work . It will be mostly original work , of course , as we have no precedents to guide us or hinder us . " ( Woman's Journal , May 31st , 1913 ) Newport , a fashionable sea - side resort on the East Coast of the U.S.A. , is making an experiment in appointing ten young women to supervise the beach , and to enforce the regulations with regard to bathing . These women police are reckoned as members of the regular force , wearing a uniform and carrying Chicago is now considering the appointment of ten policewomen as an integral part of the city's force . batons . Germany also has its women police . In thirty - one towns women have now been appointed in this capacity , mainly for the purpose of preventive and rescue work among women and children , but in some towns as part of the regular police force . Frau Schaptro , of Mayence , is engaged in the repression and prosecution of open immorality , and has to keep suspicious persons in a particular district under observation . It is also part of her duty to take part in raids on doubtful hotels and lodging- houses , and to conduct the official business with keepers and inmates of " tolerated houses . " The Women's Associations have a very strong objection to a woman being concerned with the State regulation of vice , but of the value of the preventive work done by women police there can be no doubt . Their official position gives them a very much stronger position than that of the Police Court Missionaries who attempt similar work in this country , and before long , no doubt , our big cities , too , will have their force of women police . It is not only as police officers that American women are beginning to help in the administration of the law . Chicago can boast of a woman judge , Miss Mary M. Bartelme , who has proved such a success that other cities are likely to appoint ladies in the same capacity . Miss Bartelme is head of the Court for Delinquent Girls , a branch of the Juvenile Court , which was established in 1899. In this Court men are rigidly excluded unless they are actually concerned in a case as plaintiff or witness , and it is staffed entirely by women clerks and women probation officers . Very different is its atmosphere from that of an ordinary Court . The whole idea of Miss Bartelme's administration is to help , not to punish ; but she is no senti- mentalist , and the wonderful influence she gains over the girls who come before her is the result of strength of character , as well as of motherly sympathy . Judge Pinckney thus sums up her character : - " Miss Bartelme is admirably fitted for her position . She is an acute and well - trained lawyer , with a distinctly judicial temperament . Her mind is quick and comprehensive . " She has poise , cool judgment , and a fine , discriminating sense of justice . Few men , no matter how wise or good , are capable of passing judgment on girls who have erred , because few men have a clear under . standing of woman's nature . " Miss Bartelme is the right woman in the right place . She has a man's intellect and judgment and a woman's heart , sympathy , and intui tive knowledge of feminine characted and feminine viewpoint . " It is to be hoped that the idea of a special court for delinquent girls will soon be imitated in this country . M. M.

AUGUST 1 , 1913 . In Parliament . THE COMMON July 23rd . FACTORY INSPECTOR'S REPORT . - The debate on the Home Office Vote revealed a very unsatisfactory state of affairs as to the conditions under which women and young girls work in certain parts of the country in factories and workshops . several members pointed out , the time allotted for the discussion of the Factory Inspectors ' reports one day - was totally in- adequate to the importance of the subject . As Mr. J. R. MacDonald ( Lab . , Leicester ) reminded the House that members " discussed the Army and Navy day after day , but the matters dealt with in this Report are as much concerned with national safety , although they are of a different kind . " " The shortest of them , " said Mr. Hills ( of Durham ) would take Mr. J. R. MacDonald dealt a whole day to debate properly . ' with the evils of the Truck Act , and cited a case where a girl was illegally fined , and on her giving notice of this the money was refunded to her , but she was dismissed . Although the whole subject of the administration of the Truck Act had been investigated and reported on , and there was practical agreement between the majority and minority reports , nothing had been done . " C Mr. P. Morrell ( L. , Burnley ) spoke of the long hours and overwork : The employment of women immediately after childbirth " : The absence in some localities " of any provision of decent sanitary accommodation for women and girls in factories . " Cases of these were given that were " perfectly outrageous , and some almost too bad to read to this Committee . Women are forced to go on working under conditions that are an offence to decency and a menace to health . " Lord H. Cavendish Bentinck ( U. , Nottingham , E. ) drew attention to " another form of brutality and inhumanity that goes on , that is , putting children to work on moving machinery , " and to the large number of accidents resulting to girls under sixteen , and the unhealthy underground workshops . He pleaded for the abolition of all deductions whatsoever , to put them away root and branch . ' Mr. McKenna ( Secretary of State for the Home Department ) admitted that " in one respect he stood before the Committee in a white sheet . " He had hoped to bring in and carry through He Bills affecting the points raised , but was unable to do so . was anxious to promote legislation dealing with underground workshops ; in fact , he had a Bill ready , and would be glad to have any assurance that it would go through in reasonable He made the interesting confession that he had con- sulted Mr. Booth ( L. , Pontefract ) himself on this Bill , who had no objection , " but Mr. McKenna now wished to know whether Lord H. Cavendish Bentinck could speak for Sir F. Banbury ( U. , London , City ) . It appears that if only some guarantee not object , ' could be given that Sir F. Banbury would time . " the Bill had a prospect of going through . Meanwhile , the women and girls in the underground workshops must patiently wait for the decision of the hon . member for London City . Their comfort hangs on his nod . Nearly every member paid high tribute to the work of the women factory inspectors , and to the excellence of their reports . Mr. MacDonald wished that " the Chief Inspector could only take one of his lady inspectors and get her to write up his report . We should get something worth reading , and something illuminating , " instead of the " dull barrenness , the utter lack of meaning of the Chief Inspector's report . Mr. Hills went so far in his admiration as to say that the work of the women inspectors really puts shame upon the men . 33 An allusion to Women's Suffrage glided into the discussion on the appointment of more women inspectors . Lord Henry Cavendish - Bentinck had called the attention of members to the fact that in the South - Eastern District one woman inspector with two women assistants had to inspect 50,000 factories , with 376,000 workers in the course of a year . When I raised this point last year , the Rt . Hon . Gentleman ( Mr. McKenna ) said we ought to be content because the ground was covered by the male inspectors . That is the sort of argument used by the Prime Minister against Female Suffrage . He says women ought to be content to let men carry the necessary reforms for them , because they can do it much better than the women can do it themselves . " Mr. Joseph King ( L. , Somerset , N. ) , grieved , no doubt , at the aspect of Mr. McKenna in the white sheet of a penitent , hastened to offer his homage , and to assure him of the << amiable approval of the House " of " my Rt . Hon . Friend's administra- tion , " more especially of the Cat and Mouse " Act . Mr. King laboured under the " amiable " illusion that the taxpayers contributed to the expenses of the nursing homes for the

CAUSE . 289 released hunger strikers . These homes , he thought , were chosen by the Home Secretary , and that he therefore paid the patients ' bills . On receiving an emphatic " No " from Mr. McKenna , Mr. King said he was glad to hear it , but " if ever the Rt . Hon . Gentleman had to pay the bill , I hope he will combine due comfort with proper economy . Amiable Mr. King ! July 25th . 33 MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS . - Capt . H. M. Jessel ( U. , St. Pancras , South ) asked the Prime Minister whether his atten- tion had been called to a request from some forty members of the medical profession asking for the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate the facts concerning venereal diseases , and to recommend what steps should be taken to cope with these diseases , and whether the Prime Minister proposed to take any action in the matter . The Prime Minister : " The request is receiving careful attention . ' July 26th . NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT AMENDMENT BILL - MATERNITY BENEFIT . The 47 members of the Standing Committee on the Amendment Bill were manifestly unable to speak with any authority on behalf of the women for whom they were legislating . Mr. O'Grady ( Lab . , Leeds , E. ) said he had never " heard the question submitted or discussed before this Committee as to what wives would think of taking this maternity benefit out of the control of the husband . " " Mr. P. Magnus ( U. , London University ) made the safe suggestion that Mr. O'Grady should ask them . Mr. O'Grady confidently asserted that if a plebiscite of married women were taken on the question , they would by an overwhelming majority protest against it . " How familiar these supposititious overwhelming majorities " are ! What about the resolution of the Co - operative Guild ? Several of the members expressed considerable anxiety about slur on and " the insult to " working men if the maternity benefit should be paid to the wife . Mr. G. H. Roberts ( Lab . , Norwich ) abhorred the idea of the State stepping in between husband and wife , and also to what he termed " legisla- tion against sex . ' the " " At the conclusion of the debate the 47 gentlemen arrived at the momentous and epoch - making decision that " The maternity benefit shall in every case be the mother's benefit . " We are really moving at last ! July 29th . HOUSE OF LORDS . AFFILIATION ORDERS BILL . - Lord Bathurst moved , on the Report stage , that << where payment has been ordered to be made to the collecting officer , the person on whom the affiliation order has been made shall give to the collecting officer notice in writing immediately upon any change of his address or place of abode , and if he fails to do so without reasonable excuse he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding two pounds . " The amendment was agreed to . REFORM OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE . The Nation has some very interesting correspondence on the subject of Parliamentary procedure . Those whose sorrowful duty it is to study the columns of Hansard will endorse with enthusiasm most of the criticisms made . It is almost incredible , until one learns from bitter experience to believe it , to what a length repetition may be carried without infringement of " order . " Members who were only present for part of the debate will make over again , and at immense length , points that have been made already ad nauseam . Members who wish to be obstructive will repeat and re - argue points even if they them- selves know perfectly well they have been made in every speech . One gentleman recently seized the opportunity offered by a resolution in favour of a National Theatre , to speak at length on the possibility of Shakespeare being Bacon ! There are , no doubt , ways of improving procedure , and it is greatly to be hoped that such ways will be found , and followed by the proposed Parliamentary Commission . But it is also clear that no rules can ever be devised by which a large deliberative assembly can be enabled to get through its work , if the public opinion of that body is not set hard against those who purposely waste time . Not rules , but a sense of decency and fairness should prevent the House of Commons from spending hours and days over trifles . If honourable members could suppose that any good thing could come out of Nazareth , we would suggest their attendance at a National Union Council , where , in spite of large numbers and many untrained debaters , the business is done because everyone present is determined that it shall be done , whether they like the decisions made or oppose them .

290 Some Recent Books . are MR . FLEIGHT . By Ford Madox Hueffer . Howard Latimer , Ltd. , pp . 306. 6s . " Mr. Fleight is a brilliant satire on modern political conditions and party The human politics . beings subordinate to the " machine , ' political life , they so often seem to be . They are not unreal , but they are almost irritatingly unknown , anxiously subordinate " as , in because they themselves to politics , journalism , and other inhuman The attitude of a really systems . attractive , honest , and unambitious young man , towards the man who pro- poses to go into politics without a com- plete abandonment of all his private convictions , is perfect in its complete reversal of the accepted beliefs of people outside political life . Mr. Blood having pointed out that a certain candidate for Parliament has strong " convictions , " and on certain matters " couldn't vote with you without being a cad , " Mr. Debenham got up : Then it isn't any good , he exclaimed . " I'm not going to do anything to endanger party discipline . By Jove , ' Mr. Blood " " " << THE LAST FEW said , " how you have caught the Chancellor's contagion That's because he's perfectly right , Debenham said .

( Sidgwick & Jackson . 3s . 6d . net . ) Miss Mayor has written a most touching story , woven out growing out of , what some might call the dullest of dull themes There is not a dull moment in the book , which is instinct with human sympathy , sense of fun , and sense of sorrow . It is the life - history of an unattractive old maid , one cursed with enough to live on , not enough to do , and the sixty years from birth to death brought before us on a novel plan , worked out with delicate strength and simplicity . It is the brief pathetic chronicle of a futile life , exactly a wasted life , Mr. Masefield says in his appreciative duction , because it was never used at all in any way , but with the dull misery , we might answer , that attends on that most form of waste . Miss Mayor is far too much of an artist to dream of making her book a feminist tract : it is the concrete presentment of a faulty human person , longing for love from someone , man , woman , or child , but ungifted with the nameless charm or winning self - surrender that ensure it : vaguely longing for thing to do , yet without the persistence and energy that finds Such persons , we say impatiently , are miserable anywhere , and any conditions . But that is not true , and part of the truth in Mayor's work comes from her sense of how hardly conditions bear on such a type , of the cruel suffering , for instance , that meaning parents lay up for their daughters , training them for and nothing but love , to leave them stranded and wretched if should pass them by . Miss Mayor's story is set some thirty back . But has the age gone by so completely ? The spirit of it presses on too many in their youth , condemning them in advance to the rapid misery of a Henrietta , a spirit that our movement would drive , if it could , out of the world for ever .

AUGUST 1 , 1913 . THE COMMON IMPRESSIONS OF " Finest Demonstration Ever Seen in the Park . " As the Editor has asked me to give an impression of the Pilgrimage as I saw it , I naturally proceed to give , not my own impression at all , but the impression communicated by an official whose duty it has been during many years to be present at the great mass gatherings of London . But the glorious and triumphant show on Saturday would not have been possible without our Pilgrims and their six weeks of Pilgrimage . There have been wars and rumours of wars , but I , with the theological virtue of prudence well developed , did not join them until the calm dawn had begun which heralded our triumphant entry into London . They talk to us of the North and of the progressive spirit up there . Be it known to all and sundry whom it may concern that since the eight Pilgrimages entered the Metro- politan area about the middle of last week , not only has there been no hint of rowdiness or hooliganism , not only have dissentients to our resolution at the forty or fifty meetings numbered in each case a tiny proportion of the audience , but , of deeper significance , the supporters of this same resolution , as shown " in the usual manner , " Central News.j PILGRIMS ENTERING have been the solid bulk of each crowd , whether indoors or out . The apathetics nowhere . For , indeed , while to some of our gallant Pilgrims as they contended with the darkness of calumny and prejudice , it had seemed as if " the tired waves " of progress only lost themselves in the sand and fell again back , there was waiting for them at the end the vision of how , with truth and justice over- coming , " floods in the main . " SUFFRAGISTS ATTRACT THOUSANDS TO " ANTIS ' " HUNDREDS . By birthright I am a Watling Streeter , and at Beaconsfield I saw , on the eve of the arrival of the main body of Pilgrims , the Anti- Suffrage lady and gentleman hard at work on the Green . Their crowd numbered about two hundred ; say , one half grown - up men and women , one quarter our native hooligans , and one quarter children of anti - suffrage tendencies . Their resolution was carried amid cheers by some three - quarters of this motley crew , by no means excluding the hooligans and the children , bless their little hearts . Then we came along , banners flying , and singing Pilgrim lays like larks , and they booed us in a friendly sort of a way as in duty bound . had a crowd of over two thousand , and when we called upon all in favour of Woman Suffrage to shout " Aye " and to give three hearty cheers - lo , it was so ! and a tiny ironical echo died on the evening breeze before it came to birth , and the booers ceased from booing and the roysterers went to rest , and report runs that the great Mr. We

" the milk - boy and another broke my windows , and threw in the farm eggs and something that smoked ; and the march ( after a good night's sleep ) went marching on . VERDICT OF BARNET'S OLDEST INHABITANT . " " On Thursday , I motored off trimmed up to the nines in COMMON CAUSE posters and such pretty baubles to find the Brighton Road Pilgrims ; and a smart lot they were , everybody jolly and friendly round them , and the Kingston Station Approach meeting carried the resolution unanimously and with cheering . At night I became a Great North Roader , and the oldest inhabitant of Barnet ( probably the oldest , anyway the wisest ) told me it was the very ever held in the town . There largest meeting were two delightful sandwich men of the " Women don't want votes " sort , who took my leaflets with a friendly grin , and Barnet proceeded incontinently to declare by show of hands that in a superlative On degree Barnet and its women did want women to have votes .

" Friday , at midday , reverting to type , I became a Londoner with the little Hampstead and Golders Green contingent at the Hampstead pond , and here we found one dissentient and thirty - two shillings in small coins , and yet do not some of the most virile Anti - Suffragists reside in that borough ? I trow so . SOUTH LONDON'S WELCOME . But Friday night ! Those who were at King's Hall in St. George's Market by the " will not soon forget how Elephant South London welcomed the Kentish Pilgrims ' Way and their allies of Brighton Road . Our Bermondsey Labour friends , and the organised railwaymen in their workmanlike uniforms , and last , but not least , the drums and fifes and the gorgeous giant banners of " the sons of toil , " all there and all out to make the thing go as it ought to go . High spirits and sobriety , and sympathy and the genius of orderliness , keeping watch and ward lest the ladies should suffer discourtesy ! The band played us in , and at first we thought we should never get to the speeches because everyone shouted to the challenge , " Three cheers for the women , " and we , not to be outdone in courtesy , gave " Three cheers for our friends the Labour men . " But at last Mrs. Snowden , who had with her a contingent of American friends , rose and received a great ovation . And when a solitary with a grievance cried out a little too persistently , the others quickly overcame him with moral force , and one of the good jokes

292 THE COMMON of the evening was when someone roared " Chuck him out , " for they When the band broke out knew that that was not our way . again during the pause for the enrolment of " Friends , " for pure joy they had to clear a space at the back for four men to dance a hornpipe on , and though a jovial policeman came along and said " How now , somehow it seemed all right and nobody really minded a bit ; for all the time we felt that the new chivalry was protecting us , and that the main body of the audience had through all a deep seriousness ; and when one grand shout of " Aye " cleaved the roof at the resolu- tion , we knew there was a force behind it with which Governments must reckon . << FRIENDLY CROWD IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE . Even such delights as these had to come to a close , for we had a busy day before us on Saturday . I was at Trafalgar Square , and that , too , was a merry sight . For over an hour a friendly crowd watched us as we marshalled ourselves , and THE COMMON CAUSE , only official programme , " sold like hot cakes ; so did the pirated " only official programme " ( as the vendors called it with half a wink in their eye at us ) , price 2d . , and we forgave them and they us , for when a customer more canny than the rest rejected their wares , one of them with a cheerful smile poked me so that the lady might purchase the real article ! Spurious I walked as " Guide " ( a high and coveted post , given only to the best ) to the Brighton Road lot once more . An eager working - man sprang out of the line at one point when he caught sight of me to demand , " How did it go at King's Hall last night ? " but generally the line kept itself almost without help from the police . We Suffragists are beginning to know a few things about processions , and even the friendly chaff , a funeral ? as our head guide set the pace for the leading group dead slow , did not make her lose her head and fall into the trap ; for is it not a fact that if the front rank walk briskly , the tail is perceived to be in an unseemly scramble ; and is it not also a fact that no one unlearned can comfortably read the enscrolled legends , to say nothing of the features of our leaders , if people are walking at the double ? A VETERAN PILGRIM . < " Is this My place was on the West Country platform , and there we began with three cheers for the Pilgrims , and delight and enthusiasm could go no further when later Mrs. Ramsay told them how she had walked from Land's End ( in six weeks , not as the Press had it yesterday , in one week ! ) . They tell me I'm eighty , but take off twenty years . My daughter is a doctor , and could not go , and we And then she suddenly said , Mother , were very disappointed . why should not you go ? And I said , " Well , I'll go the first stage just to encourage them , " and I did ; the next morning I packed up again and walked again , and the next day and the next , I did the same , and well , I'm here ! ( Roars of joy . ) And then Mrs. Ramsay recited the Anti - Suffrage malediction , as , with bell , book , and candle , it had been read over her : " I'd like to duck you in the river , and to tar and feather you , and to tie you up in a sack and roll you into the pond , and I desire to shut you up in a lunatic asylum and to burn you . " This the crowd thought exquisitely funny as they gazed at the delightful , good - tempered , motherly lady who placidly recited it to them . At last the Chairman plucked her garment as a sign , and sternly was deaf to the call , " Go on , go on , for the resolution was to be put . " We demand a Government measure of Women's Suffrage , and again a roar went up from one or two thousand voices , Aye " and " the contrary " was one timid voice , " No , ' which provided artistic relief for the final rounds of cheering . " " AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION . As I have not given a hundred pounds for extra COMMON CAUSE pages , I must stop very soon . But at night the Watling Street dinner party in Alan's Tea Rooms - oh ! and on Sunday , the spectacle of the Strand and Fleet Street filled by a long file of those Suffragists who cared to go to St. Paul's , and ne'er a policeman because their protection had become anachronistic ; and the Cathedral dome filled with the red , white , and green , and the cheers for Mrs. Fawcett when she appeared at a window to her followers after the service , and the delightful tea party given to us by officers of the N.U. and Miss Royden at the Ethical Church in the evening , with her message : " The Pilgrimage is not over , it seems to me it has only just begun ! We go forward with hope renewed : - " Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide , In the strife twixt truth and falsehood , for the good or evil side ; Some great cause , God's new Messiah , offering each the bloom or blight , Parts the goats upon the left hand from the sheep upon the right , And the choice goes by for ever twixt that darkness and that light . " We go forward in the faith that soon now our country will choose that light . THE PILGRIMS IN LONDON . A. H. W. 33 39 " How will London receive us ? " That was the question we had all been asking during the long weeks of the Pilgrimage . London had had militant outrages , London had fixed its eyes on broken windows and damaged letters , on bombs real and sham , and London had been very angry . But London at last understands the difference between militant and law - abiding Suffragists . " Wot I ses to you , a Cockney remarked to me on Saturday , " is this . Madam , I ses , I'm perf'ly ready to give you the vote , I ses , but may I respect'fly mention as ' ow my winders is not hinsured . " And so London , like the rest of the country , while it deeply resents the policy of outrage , is beginning to realise the strength and reason of the constitutional movement , and was prepared to give the Pilgrims its kindliest

CAUSE . AUGUST I , 1913 . welcome . On Friday night and Saturday morning every Pilgrim wearing the cockle - shell , haversack and sash in the streets was observed with the greatest interest . In one well - known shop in the West End , I had to shake hands with all the assistants in the department where I was shopping , because they had read all about our adventures in the COMMON CAUSE , and had been selling the paper for us after shop - hours the preceding evening . FRIENDLY RECEPTION OF PROCESSIONS . The four processions to the Park on Saturday afternoon had a very friendly reception all along the route . The crowds were by no means dense until we drew near the Park , but there were interested spectators at all the windows , and at many points hats and handker- chiefs were waved , and people wished us luck and congratulated us on the success of the Pilgrimage . The battered Pilgrimage banners contrasted proudly with the gay silks and velvets carried by the various Societies and Federations in the long line behind them , but the colours made a brave show , and the St. Helena banner borne by the North - Eastern Federation , the factory chimneys on the Hudders- field banner , and the towers and spires of Oxford on the splendid banner designed for the Oxford women students by Mr. New were especially striking . Many well - known people walked in the pro- cessions , and a number of working women who had not been able to take part in the Pilgrimage managed to come from all parts of the country by train to be present at the demonstration in the Park . THE COMMON CAUSE had a brisk sale , and at Montague Place every copy of the souvenir number was sold before the procession started . Carriages and motors adorned with National Union colours , and COMMON CAUSE posters whirled up and down advertising the paper , and Pilgrims sold the copies and rattled collecting - boxes on either side of the procession . All was brightness and good humour , and the most light - hearted were those who had walked all the way and endured the greatest hardships . LARGE CROWDS AT NINETEEN PLATFORMS Miss In the Park each of the nineteen platforms had as large a crowd as the voices of the speakers could reach , and between the crowds and round the outskirts rode Miss Collum and her colleagues on horseback , enrolling Friends of Women's Suffrage , while other Pilgrims distributed leaflets and collected alms . One of the largest crowds was that gathered round the President's platform , where Miss Margaret Robertson presided , while Mrs. Fawcett , Mrs. Chapman Catt , Mrs. Cooper , and Miss Courtney were the speakers . Robertson spoke of the world - wide Pilgrimage which Suffragists had carried on all over the civilised world for such long and weary years . There was a deepening sense of the greatness of the movement . The women in the towns and villages were looking at us with the dawning light of hope in their eyes . Often we were met with the taunt that we were well - to - do women , but those who had the opportunity had to come out to fight for the women who had no leisure and make their far greater needs known . " We are fighting for the women in the slums , we are fighting for the women in the sweated dens . We are here to - day to speak for the women who cannot speak for them- selves . " Miss Robertson remarked that we had been accused of having had a bogus Pilgrimage . It was said that no one had under- taken it for more than one stage . But we had never pretended that every Pilgrim had walked all the way . Some had done so , and many had walked for a week , two weeks , three weeks . Some had only Even Suffragists been able to spare a week - end , or one or two days . have homes , " said Miss Robertson , and these virtuous Suffragists had refused to neglect them . " AN OLD STAGER " 66 Mrs. Fawcett , who described herself as an old stager , " spoke of the hopelessness of relying on a private member's Bill . The Pilgrims were here to demand a Government measure . The Pilgrimage was the biggest piece of organisation the National Union had ever under- taken . It was begun on Waterloo day , and the Pilgrims had made a very valiant fight . Though they had not been very favourably impressed with the " chivalry " shown them by the hooligans of certain towns , in the great bulk of the towns they had received an unbounded welcome . The success of their cause depended on the support of men as well as of women , and they had been greatly cheered by the sympathy shown them . The Pilgrimage had three main objects . In the first place , it meant the renewal of the dedication of personal service , because the Suffrage movement was no less a cause than the uplifting of the human race . Its second object was to show the strength of the non - militant Suffragists , and its third was to visit the people of this country in their own homes and villages , and explain to them the real meaning of our movement . " What has been given to native races , " said Mrs. Fawcett , we demand should be given to the women of our own race . We are not political serfs . We have not the serf's mind . We are working for the uplifting of women all along the line , and to get power to contend against that most terrible of all evils , the White Slave Traffic . At Buda Pesth this year the delegates from California declared that they had been able to do more in twenty months to put down the White Slave Traffic since they obtained the vote than they had been able to do in twenty years without . In 1907 , the men of Norway had " an awful terror of women , and were anxious to keep them " in a manageable minority , " but now Womanhood Suffrage had been given by the free consent of all political parties . Mrs. Fawcett appealed to the men in the audience to do all in their power to help on the cause . 33 66 THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL SUFFRAGE ALLIANCE ON THE EFFECT OF THE WOMAN'S VOTE . Mrs. Chapman Catt said that in all times there was some great idea floating above the heads of the great bulk of the people and

The emancipation of women was the loftiest and grandest idea of to - day , for it meant the upliftment and emancipation of the whole human race . women of to - day are claiming their rightful places by the side of their fathers and brothers and sons . They are no longer content to lag behind them in the march of progress . " We have no complaint to make against the Government you men are making - for yourselves , but it doesn't please us . " The women's point of view must be represented . Mrs. Catt spoke of the effect of the vote in those countries where women have already been emancipated , and declared that from the point of view of the mothers the laws of Australia and New Zealand were infinitely better than those of this country or America . " Is there , " she asked , " one among you so ignorant that he does not know that Women's Suffrage is bound to come ? Then why not hasten the day ? " ( A Man's Voice : " Why not ? " ) Was England or America to get the vote first ? America was making such rapid progress that it looked as though England would be beaten .

There were between eighty and ninety speakers , almost all members of the National Union , and accounts reach us from all sides of the magnificent speeches made at all the platforms . Nothing was more remarkable than the rivetted attention of the densely packed crowds , the frequent cheering , the universal enthusiasm . The resolution was passed in every case by an overwhelming majority . At the platform at which the writer was stationed when the resolution was put , there were only two dissentients , and one of these she had just encountered leaning against a fence quite beyond earshot of the nearest platform , staring blankly into vacancy . When the bugle rang out he pulled himself together . " Hullo , " he exclaimed to a companion , " they're going to put a resolution . I must hurry up and vote against this . " There are still many who stand obstinately outside our movement , refusing to listen to our claims . At some places we have been refused a hearing by an entire crowd , but wherever our arguments are fairly heard we are steadily gaining ground , and can always carry a Suffrage resolution .

CAUSE . 293 OUR APPEAL IS TO THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN . On Sunday afternoon , the Pilgrims assembled in Trafalgar Square and marched to St. Paul's , where they attended the afternoon service . Long lines of women , wearing red , white , and green sashes , filed into the Cathedral for about half an hour , and the quiet assembly gathered in thanksgiving at the end of its long Pilgrimage made a very impressive spectacle . Outside a procession , organised by the W.S.P.U. , was making its way from the East End to Trafalgar Square , and later in the day I found Whitehall still thronged by people who had been watching the arrest of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst , and were perhaps waiting in the hope of her reappearance . Some militants asked me why the Pilgrims had not tried to go to Downing Street , why we were not going in procession to the House of Commons , why a few of us who had been invited to tea on the Terrace were not seizing the opportunity to make a Suffrage speech to the members . But our appeal has been , and is , not simply to Ministers or Members of Parliament , but to the people of Great Britain .

294 THE COMMON After the To All Pilgrims . From our President . When I wrote about the Pilgrimage on May 9th , I said it was the biggest thing that the National Union had ever planned in the way of a Demonstration , and that the whole success of the enterprise depended on the hearty and loyal support of our Societies and Federations . These I asked for , but I was absolutely certain they would be given ; and my confidence and the confidence of the Executive Committee have been amply justified by the events of the last six weeks , culminating in the magnificent demonstration in Hyde Park on Saturday last . To all I offer heartfelt thanks ; to the Pilgrims individually and to the Societies and Federations for the wonderful way in which they worked to carry out the plan which was laid before them only a little more than two months ago . Special thanks are due to the London Society , on whom fell the very great task of the organisation of the various groups of Pilgrims from the moment they arrived within the Metropolitan area . Thirty public meetings were arranged and successfully carried through by the London Society on July 24th and 25th all over the huge mass of London , leading up to the splendid demonstration in Hyde Park on the 27th . enormous Special thanks are also due to the staff in all our offices , who worked unweariedly to make the demonstration worthy of our Cause , and representative of the strength and vitality of the National Union . And above all to Miss Crookenden , our Secretary , whose organising I am quite sure that the genius controlled and directed all . Pilgrimage has been an success already as propaganda , and has justified the highest hopes of its originators , among whom Mrs. Harley was foremost . The Pilgrims have carried the message of the Law - Abiding Suffragists into innumerable towns and villages . For the most part they were warmly welcomed , but even in places where hooliganism was let loose upon them , their calm courage and devotion made a deep impression , and brought to their cause many new sympathisers and friends . Those devoted Pilgrims who walked the entire way from the furthest points deserve a special word of appre- ciation . I believe that the National Union is already reaping , and will continue to reap for many a long day , a harvest from the seed that was sown during the Pilgrimage of June and July , 1913 . MILLICENT GARRETT FAWCETT . 39 MISS MABEL Secretary , N.U.W.S.S. , to whom staff of helpers , was due the Final Demonstration in Hyde [ Photo by Le The Service in St. Paul's . Over a thousand Pilgrims attended the service in St. Paul's on Sunday afternoon , when the Rev Canon Simpson preached on the text : " Go , return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus ( 1st Kings , xix . , 15 ) . His message to the Pilgrims was one of hope . He reminded them that success was not the standard by which work should be measured , and warned them that spiritual depression must be endured by all who had the courage to fight the old opinions of the world . " There is no other faith but this which can stand alone against the world . When a man can say : ' I do not care what amount of success may attend what I believe - my faith is wholly independent of current opinion he is in training for the work of a prophet . " Final Impressions . Under- The Pilgrims now in London have much to tell of kindness shown , as well as hardship endured . Not only did a cobbler mend the boots of one contingent for nothing , and a golf - caddie insist on giving a shilling to the collection , but flowers were strewn in the path of the marchers , and for a while they literally walked on roses ! standing was , it is true , not always quite complete . " Ah , you're one of them as don't eat , , " said one man , shaking his head at a rather thin Pilgrim , who had really not been hunger - striking . But elsewhere it was better . " They're not the worst sort , " said one encouragingly ; and another having emitted the usual shrill cry of " Suffragette ! " hurriedly corrected himself " Oh , no , I see - COMMON CAUSE . " Four Generations of Pilgrims . In the West of England , four generations of one family took part in the Pilgrimage , the last being represented by two very youthful Pilgrims indeed . Between them , the two great - grandsons of John Bright collected 12s . for the Fund , and rested content in the assurance that the Vote was now secure .

Mr. and Mrs. Haslam , both over eighty years old , came over from Ireland to walk in the Pilgrimage . There has surely never been a demonstration before so representative of all our strength . A False Report . We regret to say that the picturesque incident ( in a report last week ) of Miss Sterling's escape in the disguise of a policeman proves to be a canard . She did not escape . She was not disguised as a policeman . On the contrary , she held a meeting , and appeared as Miss Frances Sterling . It is suggested that a false impression might also be conveyed in our last reports of the Great North Road , when a rowdy meeting took place , and Miss Clementine Gordon was obliged to escape . It is true that Miss St. John was represented as continuing to speak , but as a few lines lower down Miss Gordon was found to be protecting her from some amiable hooligans who took the precaution to smash her glasses and so render her practically blind , we cannot think that the most casual reader will have had any doubt as to Miss Gordon's strong and persistent preference for the hottest place in any battle that was within her reach .

Sometimes , the struggle having lasted so long , the necessary machinery , the the compromises , " politics " of the movement , seemed more real than the vision that first in- spired the Suffragists to their work ; in the Pilgrimage was restored to us all its radiance and beauty . After the service , a reception was given to those present by the Spiritual Militancy League . A Criticism .

" " A Pilgrimage " All the Time . " " This is an idea which may well appal the boldest ! Nevertheless , we do desire most earnestly to record as the final impression of the great Pilgrimage of 1913 , the fact that it has justified itself a thousand times over . In the roughest places there has been much to encourage and to inspire . Those who live in the Midlands have written more letters than we can possibly publish , to say how excellent were many of the meetings , how small the number of those people who were . brutal and hostile . A working - woman " cannot help writing to say how sorry she is that any of the N.U.W.S.S. should have been badly treated " in her county ( Wiltshire ) , and gives her assurance that " there are many who firmly believe in the movement and wish it every success .

The only pity was that it was not always have the supply where the demand was , and some of our harrowed by entreaties for papers for which any sum was when they had empty hands . Will those who might have cars , and did not , remember ( for another time ) that if we more cars we could have kept sellers better supplied at where the sale happened to be most rapid ? There was no doubt in the mind of most , we believe , COMMON CAUSE really was the " Pilgrims ' Own Paper . " cars , posters , ribbons , haversacks , and the " Souvenir splashed the N.U. colours all over London . Everybody paper , and a policeman assured the editor that it " couldn't a better paper if it had been edited by a man ! " To THOSE WHO HELPED Us . We offer our heartiest thanks to Miss Dodge , Lady De Miss Vaughan Jenkyns , Miss Helen Ward , Miss Cockle Crosfield , Dr. Helen Webb , Miss Stables , and Lady Scott for lending us - or hiring for us - motor - cars and carriages were absolutely invaluable both for supplies and as Lady De La Warr lent two cars , and Miss Dodge paid for We thanks also Miss Morris , who undertook the organisation the sale before handing it over to Miss Ellis ; and most thank Miss Ellis , who with the help of Mr. Strachey the army of sellers . Nothing was too much trouble for workers , and we can only hope the splendid results of their will make them feel it was all worth while . We must hope the sellers too , whom it is impossible ever to thank personally devotion in sticking to their posts to so late an hour as so them did was beyond praise , for selling is a very tiring They will join us , we know , in thanking Mrs. Thomasson hospitably offered tea to some in her house in Sussex Gardens was instantly invaded by an army of tired and thirsty , but grateful sellers ! Among those who worked hardest , specially thank Mr. Corfield and Miss Elizabeth Banks , to her work all Friday and Saturday , and only lamented that permitted herself to leave it for two minutes , though , as she the papers she had , it was difficult to see cause for lamentation We want also to express our gratitude to those who have for the COMMON CAUSE all along the route . The advertisement to the paper by the bicycle corps , who reached a wider area of than the walkers could , has been invaluable , and to all these our warmest thanks . PLEASE FOLLOW THIS UP ! It only remains now to follow up this splendid work . Will of the N.U. make the selling of COMMON CAUSE one of important duties ? We especially appeal for sellers outside the Arch Picture Theatre ( near Marble Arch Tube Station ) , Walpole Theatre , Bond Street , Ealing , where the Pilgrimage are being shown . One seller reported the other day that she sold three dozen in an hour outside Selfridge's . Will others try this pitch ? know more about the COMMON CAUSE to - day than they did ago . They will buy , if Suffragists will sell . AN OPPORTUNITY . About sixty " Souvenir " Numbers were brought back sellers who had bad pitches . We could have sold them a times over on Saturday . They can be had now at Is . each , money will go to the " Extra Pages " fund . Please order or you will be too late ! AN APOLOGY . We regret very much to learn that some sellers who could supplies quickly enough on Saturday last , and who therefore on the issue of the week before , did not always make it buyers that they were buying a back - number . The demand great , and the interest aroused in N.U. methods and policy that many of those who wanted a paper , and did not want to the chance of being supplied later , readily bought what get at once , on being assured that , though last week's , it the N.U. paper . But we offer our sincere apologies to as has been reported to us , were not carefully informed . MEETING IN KENSINGTON TOWN HALL .

296 Correspondence . THE COMMON THE PILGRIMAGE . MADAM , The effect of the great Pilgrimage upon the public and upon the Press has been tremendous . Two important suggestions were made in yesterday's Liberal Press : - 1. That Liberal women can no longer be expected to work for anything but Suffrage candidates . 2. ( And still more significant ) That the Liberal Party should now adopt Suffrage as a part of its official programme . This in the Daily News ! No doubt the National Union Executive will take note of these declarations and shape their policy accordingly . We have the Labour Party with us , and should soon also have the Liberal Party , if nothing is done to exasperate them . It seems to me that the past week marks an epoch in the Move- ment . The opposition to the Pilgrimage from the actual voters was practically nil . As Chairman of three meetings , two of which were very rowdy , I can testify that the opposition was from hooligans and non - voters , very few indeed of whom knew anything of the merits of the subject . The impression left on the minds of the people is too good to be allowed to fade away . The Pilgrimage has broken up immense tracts of fallow ground , on which the good seed of the Union should at once be sown . For instance , the Marlborough people never heard Miss Sterling at all - only saw her , and read her excellent speech ! They would , I think , fill the Town Hall to hear her . And so in several places where the noise of the irresponsible interrupters made speech impossible . up the No doubt the Executive is awake to all this , and will follow immense advantage that the Pilgrimage has given them . W. J. AINSWORTH . [ We have pleasure in printing one among numerous letters which have reached us testifying to the same effect , and we do not doubt that the work will be pushed on at once.-ED. C.C. ] A GENERAL ELECTION POLICY . MADAM , There seems to be so much misunderstanding about the present policy of the National Union as regards by - elections that I think it would be well clearly to state what that policy is , and what it will , in all probability , mean at a General Election . It has been asserted that the National Union is in alliance with Labour . It is not . In considering what candidate the National Union shall support , regard is had , not only to the individual views of the candidates , but also to the parties to which they belong . And as the Labour Party is the only party which is pledged , as a party , to Women's Suffrage , it follows that Labour candidates whose views on Women's Suffrage are satisfactory , will generally secure the support of the National Union , because they belong to a party pledged to Women's Suffrage . But , Liberals ask , if the National Union is truly non - party , how is it that no Liberal candidate , since the new policy has been adopted , has secured the support of the National Union , though he may have been favourable to Women's Suffrage ? The answer is that the Liberal Party is not in favour of Women's Suffrage ; that solemn pledges given by the Prime Minister to women have been broken ; and that no promise has been given that those pledges will ever be redeemed . If a candidate stands as a supporter of the Liberal Party , he takes full responsibility for the attitude of the party on Women's Suffrage . But even apart from the attitude of the Liberal Party on the question , no Liberal candidate has yet answered the questions of the National Union in a satisfactory manner . No Liberal candidate has pledged himself to vote against any extension of the franchise which does not include some women . Until such a candidate appears , Liberals cannot justly complain that the National Union is unduly hostile to Liberalism , apart from the important question of the party behind the candidate . It has been asserted that the Labour Party's attitude is unsatis- factory , because they have not , as a party , voted against the Plural Voting Bill . It is probably true that the only part of franchise reform about which party Liberals care is the abolition of plural voting . But Suffragists must remember that the Labour Party in Parliament cannot act altogether independently of the wishes of their con- stituents . They have , largely through the brilliant advocacy of Mr. Snowden , Mr. Keir Hardie , and Mr. Lansbury , converted the Labour Party to Women's Suffrage . But Labour suffers just as much as , perhaps more than , Liberalism from the handicap of plural voting , and Labour members would run a great risk of censure from their constituents if they precipitated a General Election on the Plural Voting Bill . The wonder is , not that women have accomplished so little , but that , without the weapon of the vote , they have accom- plished so much . I would respectfully suggest that the General Election policy should be a development of the by - election policy- namely , the support of candidates individually satisfactory , and when all are equally satisfactory , that support should be given to the candidate whose party is satisfactory . While it seems hardly possible that any Liberal candidate will satisfactorily pass the personal test , we should all regret to see the National Union officially opposing such good Suffragists as Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Acland . H. G. BARCLAY . [ We have pleasure in printing Mr. Barclay's letter , which is especially weighty in that it comes from a Liberal . The N.U. General Election policy will , of course , be decided by a General Council , and such expressions of opinion help towards a clear understanding of the issues that will then be before us . We call the attention of our readers to the fact that it is not Liberalism , but the Liberal Party ,

Also that no " tried friend " is opposed by the Union , though none who stands as a supporter of Mr. Asquith can be supported . - ED . C.C. ] WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE IN THE MIDLANDS . MADAM , Several members of the East Midland Federation and of the Mansfield Women's Suffrage Society who were present at the meetings held by the Pilgrims in Chesterfield , Mansfield , and Newark have expressed the opinion , with which I entirely agree , that too much importance was given by your correspondent to the rowdyism which took place , and not sufficient stress laid on the fact that , in Mansfield and Newark , the Suffrage resolution was carried by enormous majorities . I was present at all three meetings , and at Chesterfield presided at one platform in the market - place , the crowd of orderly interested listeners was a sight never to be forgotten . A crowded meeting was also held in the Town Hall , where our resolution was carried almost unanimously . At Mansfield , ten thousand people assembled , and the Superintendent of Police informed us that he had never before had to deal with such a crowd : but in spite of the rowdyism which was inaugurated by a comparatively small gang of hooligans and was confined to one platform , I obtained a very good hearing from that particular platform . I then left to go to the Town Hall meeting , where our resolution was carried unanimously . At the second platform in the market - place an interested crowd listened for an hour and a - half , and the resolution was carried with only five dissentients . The Labour Party , who intended to hold a meeting before the Pilgrims came , found it impossible to do so , as the people would not hear them till we had been ; one of their members told me afterwards he estimated that seven - tenths of the crowd were favourable to our cause . At Newark , the crowd around the platform where I presided and Miss Beaver and Miss Meikle spoke , was distinctly disagreeable , but we may congratulate ourselves that we entertained the unruly element , thus allowing our speakers at the second platform - Miss Wright , Miss Norma Smith , and Mrs. W. E. Dowson - to obtain a very good hearing , and there our resolution was carried by a large majority . We do not consider , so far as we can judge , that the Midlands are worse than other areas , and when the fact that we are entirely opposed to militancy is once fairly grasped , there is comparatively little real opposition to the principle of Woman Suffrage . The fact , too , that the Antis were just ahead of us is accountable , in my opinion , for much of the rowdyism which took place . EMILY MANNERS , P.L.G. , Chairman of the East Midland Federation . [ We are glad to hear from those working in the Midlands that- as has been suggested by other writers - the opposition to the Pilgrims was the work of only a few , and aroused rather by militancy than by the Suffrage principle . - ED . C.C. ] SUFFRAGIST OR SUFFRAGETTE . A correspondent sends us the following letter which he sent to the Press , and he fears is likely to be suppressed by the papers criticised : - SIR , You quite properly head the report of the Women's Suffrage Pilgrimage , Suffragist March on London , " but presently you improperly and erroneously write of the ladies taking part in the Pilgrimage as Suffragettes ; and you write of their sashes - red , white , and green - the Suffragette colours . Now , the Suffragette colours are green , white , and purple : the badge of the Women's Social and Political Union . The word , " Suffragette , " was invented to connote such female advocates of Votes for Women as adopt ( what are called ) militant methods - i.e . , members of the W. S. & P. U. , or of the Women's Freedom League- a body smaller even than the W. S. & P. U. The man in the street thinks that every woman asking for votes for her sex has in her pocket a hammer wherewith to break his windows : he confuses the law - abiding Suffragist with the " militant " Suffragette . And you newspaper writers with your slovenly syntax encourage this confusion . - I am , yours , LEWIS THOMPSON . RESCUE HOMES FOR CHILDREN . MADAM , I see a letter on Rescue Schools by L. F. Waring in the current number of THE COMMON CAUSE , July 11th . Here in Ireland there are no schools such as are described in the above letter , although the necessity for them is as great as can be elsewhere . There are , of course , Industrial and Voluntary Homes , but not distinctly Rescue Homes , and yet the conditions described by the Mother Superior might apply word for word to several districts in Belfast . I have been trying to found a Children's Colony in a country district in Ireland near industrial centres , where a local committee could look after the children . I want only £ 500 to purchase a small farm of ten acres and a house , and so far I have only been able to get about half the sum required . Would any wealthy English people help us in order to help to rescue girl children who are at present growing up to feed this most frightful traffic ? We want to save the children before they are ruined , and also to redeem those who have been destroyed . L. A. WALKINGTON . [ We refer to this letter in " Notes and Comments . " - ED .

When the Pilgrims came within the radius , the London papers followed suit , and on Sunday they gave long favourable columns with many illustra- tions , the London Budget being particularly sympathetic . On Monday the Daily Telegraph , with its fine illustrations and two descriptive columns , gave a much - needed lead to the other Conservative papers . The Daily News published daily accounts of the Watling Street contingent on its journey from Oxford , where Miss Collum acted as correspondent . Both its leading article on Monday and the article by Mr. Massing- ham on the same day , dealing with the political aspects con- nected with the Pilgrimage , were full of significance and of particular interest . The Manchester Guardian followed its own contingent from the beginning , and besides its excellent articles , published a beautiful series of Pilgrimage pictures ; the Daily Citizen , in its leaders , has given warm support throughout . Other papers which must be specially mentioned are the New Statesman , the Nation , the Catholic Times , the Daily Chronicle , the Scotsman , the Daily Graphic , the Christian Commonwealth , and amongst the evening papers the Star stands out prominently . Treasurer's Notes . It must be a source of deep satisfaction to the many thousands who have had a part in our great Pilgrimage to know that their efforts have achieved a success that has been beyond all anticipation . The large number of men and women who have joined our ranks as new members , and the letters which pour in on us at headquarters with gifts of money for the Pilgrimage Fund , all testify to the fact that the public has not alone been impressed , but has grasped and understood the purpose and the meaning of our demonstration , which it was the mission of the Pilgrims to proclaim . That this is so , is substantially proved by the magnificent collection which has come as the direct result of the Pilgrimage , and which is now almost £ 7,900 . But the Pilgrimage Fund will remain open for yet another week , as there are many who could not themselves be Pilgrims but are anxious to send us their " ransom token of their desire to have some share in our great festival of dedication to the cause of Women's Suffrage , and with their help we shall hope to reach a total of £ 8,000 . " as a As soon as space permits , we hope to print some of the letters accompanying the donations which we have received .

" " Early application should be made to Miss Alice Crompton , M.A. , 2 , St. Andrews Square , Edinburgh , to whom also all inquiries should be addressed . Correspondents of " Common Cause , " Please Note ! Correspondents and Secretaries of Societies are again re- minded that the latest date by which reports and notices of meetings must be received is Monday , by the second post . It may seem to contribu- Saturday is a more convenient time . tors that this is unreasonably early , considering that the paper does not go to press till Wednesday ; but it is essential to have a certain proportion of material set up in type early in the week . Much of the paper cannot even be written till Tuesday , or even Wednesday morning , if we are to keep up to date with Parlia- mentary and other news . Secretaries are asked to send in only through THE COMMON CAUSE Correspondence of their Federations . Separate reports may occasionally be inserted , if there chances to be a little space available , but they are far more likely to be held over till too late . Another request we have to make is that correspondents should model their reports closely on those appearing in the paper . It may seem a matter of little importance whether the date or the town comes first , but we must secure uniformity , and the sub - editor has often to rewrite reports because they are not drawn up in the proper form . Please note that the name of the town should be on the same line as the date and following matter , and should be underlined thrice , to signify to the printer that it is to be printed in capitals . One line signifies italics . Correspondents are asked to write on one side of the paper only . In addition to reports of Societies , we are always glad to receive any items of interest connected with the woman's move- ment , such as important work done by women , fresh professions News of this kind is especially opened , or honours won . welcome if it is sent to us before it appears in the daily papers . We are anxious to make the Common Cause an up - to - date newspaper of the Woman's Movement in its widest sense . UNION Society .

AUGUST I , 1913 . Items of Interest , From Turkey comes a criticism of the Western prejudice in favour of monogamy . The great Sheikh- ul - Islam has expounded his views in a recent inter- view . But his arguments , it must be admitted , are founded upon nothing more profound than the old parable of forbidden fruit . What you forbid a man that will he covet . Out of the law of sheer perversity a code of morals has sprung up in the East , to which we in the West apparently hold a very tarnished mirror . According to the Sheikh , " the Moslem is permitted to marry more than one woman under the strictest rules and regulations . The result is virtu- ally general monogamy . The Christian is forbidden to marry more than one woman . The result is wide- The obvious spread polygamy and immorality . " deduction from all this seems to be that the more you surround a man with temptation the better he will be . Perhaps but we are not all True Believers over here . " There wasn't a man in the field to equal her " is the headline over a spirited photograph in the Daily Sketch last week of Miss Kathleen Fitzgerald taking a jump at the Waterford Horse Show . Her victory over the men competitors was a great surprise . The sound of twenty - five thousand persons simul- taneously protesting against the exclusion of women from the franchise will be expected to reach the cars of our deaf Prime Minister . The Trade Unions have plainly intimated this week their wishes on the sub- ject . Without the enfranchisement of women , they say , the special interests of working women cannot possibly be protected . All Suffragists will heartily endorse their view . Mrs. J. Borden Harriman , who , in addition to being a member of an Industrial Commission , is a noted social leader and keen Suffragist , has just managed to avert a great railway strike in America . She per- suaded the Civic Federation and the public to ap- proach both sides of the question , and brought about a conference between President Wilson , the railway companies , and the men . Why , if a woman is com- petent to perform good work like this , she is dubbed incapable of helping to choose her Parliamentary representative , is one of those incomprehensible anomalies that go to the making of a great cause . On Monday last Viscountess Wolseley was ad- mitted to the honorary freedom of the Company of Gardeners . Very few women have hitherto been honoured in this way by any of the City companies , and only one other lady , the Hon . Mrs. Evelyn Cecil -well - known as a writer on horticulture - has been given the freedom of the Guild of Gardeners . Viscountess Wolseley , who for twelve years has directed the School of Gardening at Glynde , Sussex , of which she was the founder , was admitted " in recognition of her services to horticulture in the training of women gardeners .

THE COMMON CAUSE . Forthcoming Meetings . Scotland . AUGUST 5 . Helmsdale - Free Church Hall - Speaker , Miss Why Women Want the Vote " Bury . 8.0 Secretaries of societies having been very busy with Pilgrimage work , we have only received one report- that from the East Midlands . As this will not make a page by itself , we are holding it over to publish with others next week . The Pilgrimage on the Cinema . The Watling Street Pilgrims ' procession though Ealing , and the meeting on the Common , are both being shown in detail till Sunday night at the Walpole Picture Palace , Bond Street , Ealing , in their special budget of current events . Both the pictures of the procession entering and leaving Ealing , and the records of the meeting are excellent . Miss Leadley - Brown , Mrs. Fletcher , and Miss Helen Ward are all shown addressing large crowds , and various groups of pilgrims getting Friends ' cards signed , distributing leaflets , and mending clothes , are also shown . The picture theatre is close to Ealing Post Office , and can be reached by tram , ' bus ( No. 17 ) , and Underground ( Ealing Broadway Station ) . The " Pathé Gazette , " " Eclair Budget , " and one cr two other firms which make a speciality of " diaries of current events " have secured excellent films of the processions and demonstrations on Saturday , and that these are now showing at a large number of picture palaces throughout London and the suburbs . News from Other Societies . Women's Social and Political Union . At a meeting held in Trafalgar Square , on Sunday , by the Militants , Miss Sylvia Pankhurst and others were arrested . Large crowds remained in Whitehall until a late hour last night , and Cannon Row police- station was besieged by persons anxious to bail cut friends who had been arrested . She was arrested with several others . Miss Annie Kenny was rearrested ( under the Cat and Mouse " Act ) after a meeting at the London Pavilion . Mrs. Pankhurst appeared at the meeting in an invalid's chair , and addressed the audience . The appeal of Mr. Lansbury , against the decision that he must be bound over to keep the peace , has been dismissed . Women's Tax Resistance League . The above League wish to announce that their offices will not be closed this year during August as previously , but only from Friday , August 1st , to Wed- nesday , August 6th . At the Bromley Police Court , on Monday , July 21st , Mrs. Kate Harvey , of Bracken Hill , Bromley , was summoned for non - payment of the Insurance Tax in respect of her gardener , William David Asquith . She was charged on ten counts under the National Insur- ance Act , and pleaded guilty . Mr. Dawson , solicitor for the Insurance Commissioners , said that although Mrs. Harvey had been afforded every chance of pay- ing the amount without the matter being brought into Court , she objected to paying taxes of any kind . He pressed for special " costs " on the ground there was no defence and that the public should not bear the cost of a prosecution such as this . Mrs. Harvey said she was doing what every business man would do , refusing to pay for goods she could not choose . She refused to break the law by being taxed and not represented . She was fined £ 1 on each of the ten counts , costs , and special fees , in all amount- ing to £ 16 17s . London University Graduates ' Society . A petition , signed by 474 teachers and graduates of the University of London , praying for the pardon of Mrs. Pankhurst , has been presented to the King . It is drawn up in the same terms as that which , a fortnight ago , was presented by Sir Edward Busk , Professor Caldecott , Professor Halliburton , Sir Victor Horsley , Professor Karl Pearson , and Professor Sid- ney Webb . Amongst the signatures to the second petition are Helen C. I. Gwynne - Vaughan , D.Sc. , F.L.S. , Alice Corthorn , M.B. , B.S. , Beatrice Harra- den , B.A. , C. J. Martin , M.D. , D.Sc. , F.R.S. , Adeline Roberts , M.D. , B.S. , and R. W. Chambers , M.A. , D.Lit . , of University College , London . Signatures are still coming in , and it is intended to present a further petition , with all supplementary names . London Teachers ' Association . A legal case of considerable importance to Suf- fragist teachers was heard before Mr. Justice War- rington in the Chancery Division on Friday , July 25th . Resolutions on " Women's Suffrage and " Equal Pay for Equal Work " have recently excited very lively discussion and some disorder at the general meetings of the London Teachers ' Associa- tion , a society with a membership of over 180,000 , of whom more than half are women . The officers and Committee made this turbulence a pretext for formulating a new constitution in which general meetings were to be abolished and , the Association to be governed by the Committee and an elected con- ference . A so - called plebiscite of the members hav- ing been taken , the scheme was put into immediate operation , and a " conference " actually held . Many of the members felt aggrieved at what they con- sidered an attempt by the Committee to stifle the discussion of important subjects , and , finally , five members ( of whom three are officers of the Lewisham Women's Franchise Club ) took proceedings to re- strain the officers of the Association from altering the constitution otherwise than as provided for by rule 25. The judge remarked that some disorder must be anticipated in the discussion of burning political questions , such as women's enfranchise- ment , and that no plebiscite of members could justify a change in the constitution of the Society except in the manner authorised by the rules . He accord- ingly granted the injunction , the costs to be costs in the action . The effect of the judgment is that the annual general meeting must be held as heretofore . and mention THE COMMON
