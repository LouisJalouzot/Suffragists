" THE COMMON CAUSE , " APRIL 14 , 1910 . The Common The Organ of the Women's VOL . II . No. 53 . Registered as APRIL a Newspaper . The News of the Week . A Non - Party Move . The news that there is a Conciliation Committee work- ing within the House to secure non - party support for some measure of women's enfranchisement is now public property . Lord Lytton is Chairman of the Committee , and it has adherents from all the political parties . The greatest common measure seems to have been found in the existing municipal qualification , and the Committee seems to be prepared to press for reform on this basis . There are many things to be said about it , but we will make only one suggestion here , which is that the quali- fication should be made uniform in the country and not , as now , different in London from what it is in the provinces . = As for the support of the Women's Suff- rage Societies , we see no signs of their aban- doning the principle of sex equality for which they have always stood , but there seems little doubt that any recognition of women's rights would help , and not hinder , com- plete recognition , and would , as an instal- ment of justice , be welcomed by women . In this respect we con- fess we see in women Suffragists a far wider humanity than among professed adult Suff- ragists , who , for party purposes , deavouring to make much more " limited the franchise to which are en- their main objection MR . GEORGE BERRY , Photo . by Mr. Heasman , has been that it was what they called " limited . " Our experience with the petition showed us however , that the very plainly , average male elector was ready to give women householders the vote , and we are confident that any such measure would be popular in the country , which is heartily sick of the dis- ingenuous non possumus attitude of politicians . A Great Step . In France the Parliamentary Commission for Petitions , having received a requisition for the granting of the Parliamentary and Municipal vote to women , on April 5th passed the following resolution : - With respect to the request of the petitioners for complete suffrage to be given to women in order to effect

ONE PENNY . the complete representation of the nation , the Com- mission has thought it necessary to pronounce officially that it has unanimously accepted the justice of the prin- ciple of the petitioners ' request , and has recognized the essential importance which its realization would have for the country . ' " With so logical a nation as the French this is a great step . Who knows whether we may not yet be beaten in justice and humanity by them ? Eastbourne Doubles Its Women Guardians . an octogenarian Suffragist . Church Street , Ampthill . In the St. Mary's Ward at Eastbourne there were six candi- dates for two places on the Board of Guar- dians , and the two suc- cessful ones were Mr. W. H. Lucas and Miss Susan Gatliff . The latter , who is also Sec- retary of the local branch of the National Union , inherits from her father a tradition of social service . There are now four women representatives on the Eastbourne Board of Guardians , as against two previously , and the women now form one - eighth of the whole . More Suffragists as Guardians . On April 4th Miss N. O'Shea was elected Rural District Coun- cillor for the Parish of Cosham , and is the first woman to sit as a Rural District Coun- cillor on the Fareham Union . Miss O'Shea is well known to Suff- ragists for her ener- getic work in the organization of Surrey , Sussex , and Hants . Miss Hodgkinson , another keen Suffragist , and one of the vice - presidents of the Portsmouth Suffrage Society , has again been returned as P. L. G. for Havant , and , like Miss O'Shea , she was head of the poll . In Ports- mouth ten women were returned and one rejected . Women in Local Government . The report of the Women's Local Government Society is full of interest , and well repays study . An account is given of the negotiations for amending the municipal franchise as applying to women , and this is interesting at the present time when there are proposals being made for extending the Parliamentary vote to women on this very basis . Reference is made to the appointment of

2 THE COMMON Miss O'Driscoll as collector of Township Rates in Queens- town . Miss O'Driscoll succeeded her father . The curious anomalies of the municipal franchise are again exhibited by reference to the applications success- fully made by Mrs. C. W. Dixon , of Birmingham , and Mrs. McIlquham , of Staverton ; these decisions were based on the Act of 1907 , which has been very variously interpreted all over the country . There are now fourteen women town councillors in England and Scotland ; nine women on Metropolitan Borough Councils ; and three women on County Councils . A number of interesting appointments are also chronicled , most of which have been from time to time mentioned in our columns , but there is one to which we should like to draw special attention , because it is new , and that is Miss Beattie to be " Children's Visitor , " appointed by the Public Trustee . Further steps in the right direction are the appointments as Assistant Reliev- ing Officers of Miss Taylor ( Norwich ) and Miss J. Peacock ( Islington ) . Much of the work of relief can only be well done by a woman . The New Bishop of Lincoln . Canon Hicks , who has just succeeded to the See of Lincoln , is a firm believer in the enfranchisement of women . He is President of the Manchester Branch of the Men's League , and he walked in the great Man- chester procession of October , 1908 , afterwards speaking for Women's Suffrage from the Temperance platform in Alexandra Park . In fact , it is Canon Hicks ' work for temperance and purity which has brought him into the Suffrage ranks , and he himself attributes the impulse to join the movement to the influence of Mrs. Lyttleton . Mothers ' Benefit . The firm of Kelsall and Kemp ( of which Sir George Kemp , M.P. , is one of the principals ) has initiated a scheme for the benefit of married women operatives in their employ . Expectant mothers are to draw 12s . a week for twenty weeks , and the women are to decide when the twenty weeks are to begin . We know how much Sir George and Lady Beatrice Kemp have the welfare and liberty of women at heart , and this is only another instance of their wide humanity . A New Studentship for Men and Women . A sum of Â£ 3,000 has been invested as a memorial to Mr. Benn W. Levy , for the purpose of endowing a post- graduate studentship in bio - chemistry in the University of Cambridge . The studentship is open not only to men graduates , but to members of Girton and Newnham who have certificates showing that they deserved ( but were , on account of their sex , not given ) honours in degree examinations . This is , we believe , the first post- graduate studentship of the kind . Taxation without Representation . A league has been started called the Women's Tax Resistance League , and those who wish to hear more about it are invited to communicate with Mrs. Kineton Parkes , International Franchise Club , 66 , Russell Square , W.C. The following is an extract from a mani- festo issued by the League : - CC Women , being excluded from representation on account of their sex , are therefore the subjects of a Tyranny and not of a Representative Government . Women in their unrepresented condition are subject to laws affecting their interests made exclusively by men , and they are taxed by the same irresponsible authority . Women then , as moral and intelligent human beings , who should be fellow - workers with men in the making of Society , demand their emancipation from their present intolerable position , in a word they demand their Free- dom . John Hampden refused to pay a tax imposed by an irresponsible Sovereign . Women must , for the same reason , whilst representation is refused them , evade and

APRIL 14 , 1910 . resist the payment of taxes imposed upon them by a Government , which in relation to unrepresented women is as irresponsible and tyrannical as the authority resisted by Hampden . All women , married and single , from whom Imperial taxation is demanded , are invited to join this League for the Nonpayment of Taxes , in order when the right moment comes , to make one large and effective protest , and in the name of John Hampden , to resist payment to the Government's exchequer . " Unfortunately no one can resist indirect taxation , and one of the chief direct taxes , the income - tax , is often Married women deducted before the income is paid . 73 have special difficulties , since their income - tax is levied on the joint income of them and their husbands . Why Men Should Vote . The following amusing conversation is reported as having taken place at a dinner party in Ceylon : The con- versation turned on the Women's Suffrage question . The usual arguments on both sides were brought forward . A gentleman who had returned from a lengthened tour in the Colonies sat silent till the subject was well thrashed out , then lifted up his voice and said : " Men only should have votes because they pay more taxes than women . " " What taxes ? " said the Suffragist . " On whisky and tobacco , ' was the answer , spoken in all seriousness . Could there be a more convincing argument of man's superiority ? 27 English as She is Writ . An amusing instance of the beauties of the English language , as revealed in the drafting of Bills is given as follows . The extract is from the Prevention of Des- titution Bill , talked out last Friday ; one almost wonders whether one might not say it was written out . " But judge for yourselves : - " There shall be paid out of the Exchequer Contribu- tion ( Mentally Defective Grants ) Account to the council of every county and county borough and to the councils of such other cities and boroughs as may continue to act as local lunacy authorities under the Acts mentioned in the fifth schedule to this Act such a grant in aid of their expenditure under section 43 of this Act ( to be termed the Mentally Defectives Grant ) as may be deter- mined by a Secretary of State , the amount of the grant in each case being made equal to such a rate per head of the aggregate number of certified persons provided for in the institutions by all the councils of counties and county boroughs and the councils of such other cities and boroughs as may continue to act as authorities under the Acts mentioned in the fifth schedule to this Act as can be met from the Exchequer Contributions ( Mentally Defective Grants ) Account for the current year . " Of course , if such a clause were passed , it would make plenty of employment , and that is , perhaps , one of the desired by - products of legislation . The Abolitionist Federation and Wages . One of the subjects set down for discussion at the next congress of the Abolitionist Federation ( 1911 ) is : " Do the wages and conditions of women's work conduce to prostitution ? " We hope the inquiry will be productive of much good . Those who have experience and know- ledge bearing on this inquiry should write for a form of questions to the Secretary of the British Committee , 17 , Tothill Street , S.W. An Octogenarian Suffragist . Our portrait this week is of an old gentleman who signed a Women's Suffrage petition nearly fifty years ago in Birmingham , when he was working for Messrs . Clayton , and he says many of his fellow - workers signed at the same time . When the Misses Barton took the voters ' petition to him at Ampthill this year , he signed it with pleasure . He will be 87 on May 24th , and is proud that his birthday should be on that day .

Page . 134556 67910LA 10 10 11 14 A year ago " The Common Cause " began . We look back upon the hopes and intentions with which it was started , we survey the difficulties which had to be sur- mounted , and we are divided between satisfaction at the progress made and an impatient longing for much better things in the year to come . It was started as an independent venture and inde- pendent it still remains . But , when it had been in existence for a few months , it was adopted by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies as its official organ . That is to say , official news of the Execu- tive , the Organizers and the Societies is communicated and the policy of the paper , as far as Women's Suffrage is concerned , is the policy of the National Union . But it was considered that the work of the enfranchisement of women could be furthered best , not by a mere reiteration of the demand for the vote , but by publishing articles and news which should show the many sides upon which life touches women and the many ways in which the subjection of women reacts upon life , and therefore the paper is also " the Organ of the Women's Movement for Reform . ' The first of these reforms is electoral reform , and upon this everyone in the National Union is agreed ; but when we come to other reforms it is evident that points of view must greatly diverge , and therefore in all matters outside the franchise agitation we take a line for which the management of the paper is alone respon- sible . We hope and believe that we voice the opinions of many Suffragists , but it is manifestly impossible to voice them all , since all are agreed on one point only . The whole paper has , however , this in common with the National Union , that it is non - party , and it is this non- party position which is so difficult to make people under- stand . We get a large number of letters beginning : " The Common Cause ' professes to be non - party , but " and when we get so far it becomes an entertaining game to lay down the letter and speculate whether this particular correspondent will accuse us of having a con- sistently Radical tone " or of being " bitterly opposed to the Government " ; of maintaining the privileges of property as against the working woman or of being << " ) ( C

. CAUSE . 3 merely Socialistic . " The truth being , of course , that none of these statements are true , but that all our politics at present are summed up in the question , what action , what policy , what man will remove the iniquitous and inequitable sex disability under which we groan and which is the last and worst of the great monopolies ? We are not hit by the taunt that we are selfish because we ask for votes for women first . We are convinced that the women will use their votes not only for the protection of their own interests but in the interests of the whole of humanity . We have not found women the more selfish and tyrannical half of mankind , and we don't think the vote will change their nature in these respects . We advocate the simple removal of the sex disability because we think it ought not to have been imposed ; when people tell us we ought to work for a great extension of the basis of the franchise , we say that opinion among women ( as among men ) is greatly divided about this , and when the sex disability has been removed , men and women together can proceed to tackle the question of a great Reform Bill . There is another difficulty with which we were faced at the outset , and which we have met with a deep sense of responsibility and the simple intention to help truth to prevail . It is impossible to show the depth and moral passion of the women's liberation movement without showing the root at once of woman's weakness and woman's strength . Her sex is the ground of her dis- ability . How can one deal effectively with the one unless one speaks truly and candidly of the other ? Men who oppose the enfranchisement of women do so because women are women , and all the questions of women's economic , legal and political subjection , the future of the race , the hope of humanity , are involved in the question whether the rival trades of prostitution and of marriage are those alone which shall be open to women . According to this view of society , men may do anything they can do ; women are to exist merely for the propagation of the race and for the enjoyment of man . Fortunately , for the happiness and the self - respect of women , it is gradually appearing plainly for all to see that , whatever may be the case with regard to the second of these , the first cannot be well performed until women are happy and self - respecting , and this they will never be until they are free ; free to marry or not ; free to bear children or not ; free to work , and free to determine the laws under which they must live and the taxes which they must pay . So long as women are in the degrading stultifying servitude of sex , you cannot work for their liberation if you never name their sex and all it implies . So when our good friends complain , as some do , that we touch and uncover hideous social sores , we reply that they can only be cleansed if they are seen and known ; that this cleansing is not the work of specialists , but of every one of us , and that it is not enough to publish their effects in blue books or special reports which are only read by a very few ; they must be published in books and papers which are read by the many . Reform has been so difficult because the sheltered women don't know we must inform them ; because foolish selfish men have not realized the results of their folly and selfishness : we must instruct them . You cannot create horror of evil by merely calling it evil : : you must show its horrors . This is not a paper for immature persons , but we believe that any boy or girl who sees it will get no harm from knowing the truth about the world in which he and she will have to live . The third great difficulty we have is one which ulti- mately can only be met by increased circulation . We would like the paper to meet the needs and wishes of many sorts of people . There is the old , convinced " and arguments Suffragist , who is sick and tired of " who wants to have news and to be kept abreast of the movement . There is the new convert , who is hungering for fresh reasons wherewith she may defeat the enemy in dialectics . There is the educated man or woman who wants special articles , and there is the illiterate , for whom we would like to cater . There is the secretary of the small local Society who wants the names of the local people and their speeches recorded , and there is the large body of the frivolous or the tired , who want " something

4 THE COMMON readable . " In order to meet these and other require- ments there is only one way to enlarge the paper , and this can only be done if the circulation goes up . Since the paper was started we have added a picture and four pages . We would very much like to add four more pages and any amount of pictures , but this cannot be done yet . The membership of the National Union is something a little under 20,000 . If every member took " The Common Cause " and secured one other subscriber , we should do well . Is this too much to hope for ? We should like to point out to our fellow - Suffragists that , owing to the indifference of the daily Press , which is financed and edited by men , it is literally impossible for anyone who does not regularly see this paper to keep in touch with the Union . At the Council meeting one delegate suggested that canvassing gave young and new Societies or members scope for their yet untried activities , and we should like to suggest that one most deserving object for canvassing would be this paper . Further , if all secretaries would see that the paper is advertised on their handbills and posters , and would recommend it at meetings by selling it in the hall and mentioning it from the platform , and would put up posters in the hall and in all shops and committee - rooms which they use , a great deal would be done to connect the paper with the con- stitutional Suffrage movement . We know some Societies which give a free copy of the paper to every new member upon joining and accompany the gift with a subscription form . Codes of Honour . It is often said that women have no sense of honour such as men have . The question is interesting , because there is , or has been in the past , some justice in the accusation . Happily public schools and colleges for girls are making the reproach an obsolete one . Now there seems to be some natural reason for the difference between the state of affairs in the past and in the present . It seems to be this : That just as honourable people , who would not think of cheating their fellow - creatures individually , seem to consider the cheating of a company or a society a venial offence- ( I quote as an example the calmness with which otherwise honest people travel second or first in a train on a third - class ticket ) , - so there seems to be a general though undefined feeling abroad that honour is only necessary in dealing with equals . Hence in the past there has been honour in the mutual dealings of men , at least of the aristocratic class , little in the deal- ings of the same class of men with their inferiors . And as inferiors and dependents have very naturally moulded their conduct on that of superiors , and as that of their superiors has been seen at a disadvantage by inferiors who knew nothing of the mutual relations of those superiors , so it has come about that there has not been in the past so much honour in the lower classes as in the upper . Democracy is altering this state of affairs to a great extent . Now just as men of the upper classes treated those of the lower classes with little honour , so men have almost universally treated women , who have been regarded prac- tically always as inferiors , and who have generally been dependents as well . It may safely be assumed that men's honour , such as it was , was largely , though perhaps unconsciously , a tacit arrangement for mutual protection . A man's code of honour has generally not benefited , or at all events not adequately benefited , women , where women alone could benefit . For instance , it is not considered " dishonest " for a man to " dishonour It seems to be considered rather of the nature of an achieve- ment than otherwise , to commit the most cowardly of all cowardly sins the sin for which a woman must pay the penalty . It does not brand a man for ever as stealing a Â£ 5 note from a fellow - man would do . Yet there can be no comparison from a woman's point of view between the gravity of the two offences . " " a woman . Again , a man , in marrying , does not consider himself bound , or is only just beginning to consider himself bound , ( things are in such a transitional state at present that one hardly knows whether to use the past or present tense ) , to confess to his future wife that his past life has been hardly all that it should be . This point is

" The hero , after consorting with bad women , marries , and it is evident that , from the author's point of view , it is only natural that the man should not tell his wife about his previous life . He dreads her knowing . He thinks it would wreck his life if she did . And yet , in spite of man's boast of honour , he is content to live and be happy on a lie . If Sir Conan Doyle had wished to make his story a true picture of life instead of something artisti- cally pleasing , he would not have dropped the curtain fairly soon after the marriage . He would have described the sordid results of the badness of the bad woman in the background and the badness of the agreeable " hero " in the foreground . They would probably be these : A wife branded with disease or children branded with disease , perhaps both . And now comes a noteworthy point . Man has not considered it incompatible with his honour in the past to allow women ( exclusive of his victims ) to remain ignorant of the badness of men and of its ghastly results . Though he would consider it dis- honourable to induce a man to enter into any under- taking with him without explaining the risks connected with it , yet he has been content to let women enter blindly upon matrimony without knowing the possible results matters that may make all the difference between life - long misery and happiness . Women have been wil- fully blindfolded , agonised for men's badness , without being allowed to suspect the why and the wherefore of it . Hence the howl of opposition that greeted the demands of the first women who wished to be doctors . Chiefly through the agency of women doctors , women now know the truth , and this knowledge will probably cause more of a revolution in England than any scientific discovery of the age . It is a significant fact that there are over 500 medical women who are Suffragists , against fifteen who are not . The lack of honour in men in their dealings with women has had an inevitable and melancholy effect . Women see more of men in their relations to themselves than to each other , and consequently they have not an exalted opinion of their honour . They see the seamy side of it . If men could only have the " giftie " of seeing themselves as some women see them , they might be con- siderably edified . They would understand how superficial The morals of women their honour necessarily appears . have naturally been moulded by men ( how could it be otherwise seeing their dependent position ? ) , and if women have reflected the little honour that men have shown them , they are hardly to blame . The imitation may be sincerely unflattering , but men would do well to reflect that it is largely a matter of imitation . man . Happily things are changing . Women are being brought together in schools and colleges . Honour thrives amongst those who meet on equal terms , and they are learning from each other what they failed to learn from men , the possibility of treating each other honourably . They have formed a code of honour as from woman to woman , resembling that which exists as from man to This code could hardly have been evolved at a time when women were isolated from each other under the control of individual men , who neither treated them with honour nor expected honour , as they understood it , from them . This honour among women and their grow- ing esprit de sexe is a result of their emancipation . The effect upon man is admirable . Only those who hate superiority of any kind cavil at it . It is resulting in honour as between man and woman , a tendency which equality between them will consolidate . A man is beginning to see that woman is worthy to be treated honourably ( he never realised that she was dishonourable because treated dishonourably ) , and there is a growing class of men who refuse to marry a woman with a lie in their hearts if not on their lips . The time of transition is a hard one , hard for the men as well as the women , but it ought to end in the stamping out of a great deal of immorality . It is as though many men and women had seen a vision of truth , and though that vision demands the wrecking of their own lives in the present , they are willing for the sacrifice for the sake of " the gleam .

APRIL 14 , 1910 . the " THE When Is a Person Not a Person . COMMON Mr. John Whitford is fully justified in thinking that it is far more difficult for women to give the rein to their ambition than it is for men . So much is this the case , that a writer in " T. P.'s Weekly recently , reviewing Fingerpost " ( which is a guide to the professions for educated women , every article being from the pen of an experienced pioneer woman ) remarks that , after reading this book , he is forced to the conclusion that the successful woman has to possess four times as much brains and energy as the successful man . This may perhaps account for women , as a rule , showing themselves so loth to follow in the wake of the pioneer . In the course of the last two or three weeks I have met a chartered accountant and a surveyor of taxes , men who were both in a most favour- able position for judging the prospects of women in my own profession ; each had a daughter whom he was keenly desirous of articling to a woman accountant , and he was willing to pay a substantial premium for the privilege of doing so ; yet neither one of these young women , though offered the opportunity of entering a new and promising field under the most favourable auspices , could be induced to hear of it , or to give it even a moment's consideration . This sort of thing is far from encouraging , and we really cannot wonder if men are inclined to laugh at our pretensions ; although , to be quite fair , I must say I know girls ( unhappily not rejoicing in generous fathers ) , who would be overjoyed if they could command oppor- tunities which their more fortunate sisters despise . Can any of your readers tell me whether any woman has ever taken the degrees of Bachelor of Commerce or Master of Commerce of the Birmingham , Manchester , and other Universities , which are open to both sexes alike ? I hear that women cannot be got to display any interest in these degrees , and hope it is not true . is I can assure Mr. Whitford that it is quite true that women are heavily handicapped in that they cannot place the magic words " chartered accountant " after their names , as this title seems to carry great weight with the public ; though it is really very difficult to know why it does , seeing that the legal definition of an accountant one who has been admitted as a member of an ( i.e. , any ) incorporated society of accountants , " vide the Revenue Act of 1903. A woman , therefore , may be a legal accountant , but cannot be a chartered accountant , which is absurd ; yet , despite of this drawback , we still manage to get along somehow , and slowly but surely to pulverise prejudice . I have had reliable counsel to the effect that if two women were to apply to the King in Council , otherwise the Privy Council , for a Royal Charter for women accountants , so that they may be on exactly the same footing as men in the profession , it would pro- bably be granted to them , as it is such a perfectly reason- able request , and the chartered accountants have unduly strained the spirit of their Royal Charter by making it stand for a male monopoly when such was never intended . I am fully prepared to take the bull by the horns in this way if I could command any support . " 2 " " " In reply to Mr. Whitford's question re women lawyers , the Law Society of Scotland has got it established that a woman is not a person , ' and therefore cannot be admitted ( vide Hall v . Scottish Law Agents ) , and the English Society takes up the same ground - viz . , that the Law Acts only refer to " persons . This being so , it is somewhat curious to note that everyone overlooks the fact that the penalties and punishments consequent on infringing any of these Acts , likewise attach only to persons . " Ergo , can a woman , not being a person within the meaning of the Acts , be proceeded against for infringing Acts which only relate to the doings of persons " ? It is the reductio ad absurdum , but being extremely desirous to ascertain what might befall the woman who should set up practice as a lawyer , I called at the offices of the Law Society in London recently , and after much difficulty succeeded in penetrating to the august presence of the secretary , to whom I offered the above conundrum for solution . I may say that the waving of a red rag in front of a bull was as nothing in comparison , and I was hurriedly shown out . ( Also , I fear me , the hall porter got a severe reprimand for having suffered a mere woman to enter that sacred edifice . ) <<

CAUSE . 5 But I was more than satisfied . The superior person was completely floored , and he couldn't give any answer to my simple query , neither , I venture to think , can his Society furnish any answer . It is too hard , and they prefer to give it up ; as the children say . " It would seem then , that a woman lawyer , being no person , " is immune from consequences , for I believe the Law Societies would perceive the wisdom of not raising any question on an issue where they could so easily be made to appear utterly ridiculous . Dread of ridicule is a very potent factor in determining action , and they , in common with the rest of us , have probably heard of that historic personage , who , with a fine feeling for effect , exclaimed , Gentlemen , let us die , but do not let us appear ridiculous " ! 66 It therefore remains for some enterprising and ambitious LL.D. or LL.B. to set up in practice amongst women as a " consulting women's lawyer ( for she could not , of course , eat dinners or appear in court for her clients ) , and to beard the Law Society ; to impale it upon the horns of a very awkward dilemma , and delight us with the spectacle of seeing it " hoist with its own petard . ' " C " I have found that , because I advise women in regard to commercial " law , which is an obligatory subject in the accountancy examinations , I get women coming to me at the rate of about one per week , for advice in regard to the marriage laws , ( especially international ) , the guardianship of children , the making of their wills , or the question of separations , or other solutions of their matrimonial difficulties ; all of which , even with the best will in the world , are quite foreign to my province ; but a woman lawyer , well versed in all these matters , might reasonably hope to earn her bread thereby , and even , with luck , secure a little butter as well to spread upon it . As a further illustration of how the ridiculous con- tention that women are not " " works both ways , persons " I may mention that the male members of my Society ( Certified Accountants ) cannot abbreviate their title to C.A. , as the only " persons " who are allowed to use these initials are the chartered accountants ; but these latter person gentlemen have elected to interpret the word " in their Royal Charter as not including women ; therefore , if I , who am no person , " choose to put C.A. after my name instead of Certified Accountant , the Institute of Chartered Accountants , on its own showing , can have no grievance or ground of action against me .

Charles Booth show that in 1841 there were employed in a certain comprehensive group of trades 1,030,600 males , and 463,000 females ; fifty years later ( 1891 ) the numbers were 1,576,100 males , and 1,447,500 females . Whilst the increase of men was 53 per cent . , that of the women was 221 per cent . This increase is still going on . In 1901 , in the same trades , the numbers were 1,652,422 males , and 1,762,445 females . In the textile industries the comparison is much more striking . Taking the whole of the figures for 1904 - i.e , men , women and children employed in cotton spinning , weaving , and other processes - we get 326,609 females , and 195,422 males . From time to time restrictive proposals are made which strike arbitrarily at the livelihood of thousands of women . Many years ago an attempt was made to stop women sorting coal at the pit - brow in the Northern mining districts , such work , it was declared , being " unsuitable for women . The workers themselves , alarmed for their livelihood , sent a deputation to London to interview the promoters of the Bill in Parliament .

6 THE COMMON The robust , healthy appearance of the demonstrators and their spirited resistance to their own crushing out produced such an effect on the politicians that their attempt was abandoned . A similar crusade was started more recently against the nail and chain making industry , which was represented in a sensational paper as " degrading " and " unwomanly . " Investigation showed the women engaged in the trade to be on the whole healthy , athletic , and contented , preferring their inde- pendent work at little forges in their own backyards to confinement in factories ; the bars of metal used were reported to be rather thicker than lead pencils , and the labour not harder than washing or scrubbing , while the women pleaded that they were thus enabled to keep their homes and families under supervision . Again , there are philanthropists who are anxious to abolish the employ- men of barmaids , seeing clearly the degrading and injurious conditions undeniably attendant on the trade , but less troubled by the injustice of depriving 100,000 fellow - creatures of a means of livelihood . It The above attempts may at any rate be ascribed to benevolent motives . Others , however , are still less justifiable . The flower trade would be generally con- ceded to be one specially suitable for women , a large number of whom are engaged in it . The better - paid and more skilled are employed in decorating houses for balls and receptions , between the hours of 8 and 10 p.m. was recently decided to bring this trade under the Factory Acts , and as these Acts forbid women to work overtime , this artistic and better - paid designing work must , by this edict , be thrown more and more into the hands of men ( foreigners , moreover , as Englishmen , for some reason , seem to have neither taste nor aptitude for the trade ) . One more illustration - at present prospective - must suffice . The Rt . Hon . John Burns , in the enthusiasm of his crusade against unemployment ( for men ) , has pub- licly declared that the labour of women , especially of married women , must be enormously curtailed ; and not a few organizations of men - keenly alive to the benefit to themselves of lessening the competition of women- are clamouring for legislation in this direction . The foregoing instances are cited , not primarily as grievances , but to illustrate the precariousness incidental to the livelihood of any class whose liberties and actions NATIONAL UNION OF WOMEN'S OBJECT : To obtain the Parliamentary franchise for women METHODS : ( a ) The promotion of the claim of women to the all constitutional methods of agitation in the country non - party basis .

The extent to which it is justifiable to handicap the labour of adult protective women by legislation is a question on which women themselves are divided in opinion ; but assuredly it is one on which they have a claim to a voice . Until this claim is recognised , women must be for ever on the alert , ready at any moment to initiate costly and laborious public agitation in defence of the livelihood of themselves and their families . C. C. OSLER . In Parliament . The Veto . In the House of Commons last week the first of the Veto resolutions was passed , and the House proceeded to debate the second . The general tendency of the prophets is to say that the probability of an early General Election is receding ; and some people are even found to suggest that this Parliament may live till 1911 . The Prevention of Destitution Bill . This Bill , introduced by Sir Robert Price , and con- sisting of 95 clauses and 7 schedules , was debated on Friday last , and not unnaturally " talked out . " debate was marked by a complete absence of that quarrel- some and spiteful feeling which is so largely shown on all occasions where parties have something to lose . Evi- dently all parties think they have something to gain by treating poor - law reform rationally , and the new elec- tors - women - will certainly be likely to remember kindly those who made a serious attempt to grapple with poverty .

APRIL 14 , 1910 . THE COMMON Societies , and will , I hope , be passed on by them as quickly as possible to individual members of the Union . It was not possible to print them until the Executive Committee had passed the draft as being a correct tran- script of the Council's decisions ; but I am asking the Editor to find room for them if she can in this week's " Common Cause . " As I have already taken up so much space , I will not touch this week upon the vast and responsible work laid upon the shoulders of these Federations by the Council , nor upon the special work entailed by its resolutions passed on election policy . We have no time to lose in getting into marching order . In July our half - yearly Council meeting will be upon us , when we shall want to report that all is in working order and hard at work . In October will come our first " Pro- vincial Council , " which , as you know , will be a confer- ence composed of the Executive Committee and two mem- bers sent from each Federation . And who knows what may not have to be attempted between now and then ! Miss Whitehead has been appointed Secretary , and will begin work at Parliament Chambers as soon as she is free of her engagement to the London Society . The new Executive Committee met for the first time on April 7th , and elected Mrs. Broadley Reid chairman ; Miss Ashton and Mrs. Rackham were elected vice - chair- men ; and sub - committees were appointed for Organiza- tion , Finance , Literature , and Press . Besides the officers , the following members of the Committee con- sented to serve on these Sub - Committees : - Organization : Dr. E. Bentham , Miss Bryan , Miss M. Corbett , Miss C. Macmillan , Mrs. Broadley Reid , and Miss F. E. Rendel . Finance : Mrs. Auerbach , Miss M. Corbett , Miss F. E. Rendel , and Mrs. Stanbury . Literature : Dr. E. Bentham , Miss Palliser , Miss I. O. Ford , Mrs. Heitland , Miss Royden , and Mrs. Snowden . Press : Miss R. Costelloe , Mrs. Heitland , Miss Palliser , and Mrs. Swanwick . Miss Rendel has lately been acting as secretary , and the Committee expressed its obligations to her , as well as to Miss Dimock and Miss Ashton , who spent part of the Easter holidays in bringing order into the office . This was very necessary work . The move from the old office in Victoria Street had to be made just before the General Election at a time of great pressure . After the election was over , the time of the Secretary and the other members of the staff was again fully occupied with pre- paring for the Council Meeting . The inevitable result was that the arrangement and furnishing of our new office had been somewhat neglected . Miss Dimock and Miss Ashton seized the opportunity of having the rooms to themselves , and spent Friday , Saturday , and Tuesday of Easter week cleaning , sorting , packing , dusting , and putting everything in its place . Miss Ashton very generously presented the office with a chest for storing banners , and a cupboard . The result was a great improvement in the appearance of the rooms . But a splendid opportunity remains for friends who wish to help to furnish the office . Another cupboard is wanted , and a good rug for the Committee Room , and two , or even three , clocks would be most valuable presents . EDITH DIMOCK . NOTE . We regret that we have had to omit the rules for lack of space . We hope to find room for them shortly . ED . " C.C. " ] The Council Meeting . A local secretary writes complaining of the compression into one day's meeting of an agenda of such length and containing so much contentious matter . We believe that this objection was very widely felt and was completely justified . The Executive is aware of this , and it is hoped that in future more time may be given for discussion ; but of course this will necessitate the Council sitting for more than one day .

CAUSE . A Pressing Necessity . " It must be noted that the income has again been mainly derived from donations given in response to special appeals , of which there have been two during the year . The Subscription List is still under Â£ 500 , a sum obviously inadequate to meet even the ordinary working expenses of the Union . " The above is an extract from the Hon . Treasurer's Financial Statement for the year ending October 31st , 1909 , presented at the Annual Meeting , March 19th , 1910 . To raise the list to a level worthy of the Union , generous subscriptions are needed at once . It Already 10 friends have come forward with promises of Â£ 25 per annum for longer or shorter periods . ought not to be difficult to find at least 90 others to follow this example without delay . If the policy and work of the Union are to be maintained and extended , it is essential that these promises should be secured , and the money paid into the bank before the end of June . Who will help ? The Treasurer's statement also draws attention to The Million Shilling Fund recently opened , and an Appeal is now made to the affiliated Societies to do their utmost during the summer months to augment , and , if possible , complete , this fund before the close of the financial year in October next . The Council , at their annual meeting on March 19th , passed a resolution calling upon its Executive and the affiliated Societies immediately to consider the possibility of running Women's Suffrage candidates in suitable con- stituencies , and to prepare the ground . The Executive Committee have taken this as an instruction to be acted upon without delay , and they have set to work to break up and " prepare ground . " What are the Societies doing , and what are they pre- pared to do ? It is a fair question . The Council has However laid down a policy which implies expense . willing the Executive may be and they are willing- to carry out the instructions and wishes of the Council , they cannot succeed unless they have the hearty co - operation and the financial support of the affiliated Societies , who dictate and lay down the policy . We can find the workers , the enthusiasm , and the zeal . Behind these we require , and must have at once , the funds necessary to the success of the policy . In thus writing I am not unmindful of the splendid " special efforts " which have again and again been made in response to my special appeals . But work crowds upon us , and we know not how soon we may be confronted with another general election . This is not the moment to stay our hand , to limit our work , or to close our pockets . There is , I am convinced , money to be had , if only we set to work to get it . Let us during the next three months show what we can do . ( 1 ) Will 100 friends come forward without delay with promises of annual subscriptions of Â£ 25 each ? This will be good as the basis of our fresh effort . ( 2 ) Will 100 friends who may not be in a position to guarantee Â£ 25 per annum promise Â£ 10 ? ( 3 ) Will each of our Societies make it their " concern now and at once to induce each of their members to promise in addition to what they already give - 1s . per month to the National Union Million Shilling Fund ? If it is quite impossible for a member to give a shilling , will she beg it from some friends ? I read somewhere that Â£ 100,000 of the Million Guinea scheme set on foot by the Wesleyan Church was simply collected on one day by every member doing something . If all members of the Union will do something accord- ing to their means beyond and in addition to what they are already doing , the funds required will be raised . May I again press for immediate action . " He gives twice who gives quickly . " The need of the hour is funds , and for these I now plead . Contributions should be sent to the Treasurer , National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies ' Office , Parliament Chambers , Great Smith Street , London , S.W. BERTHA MASON , Treasurer ,

We are sorry that the account given in our issue of March 24th has given rise to some misunderstanding . Before the Council meeting , Miss Bertha Mason had been nominated as one of the Hon . Secretaries of the National Union , and , no one else being nominated for Parliamentary work , Miss Mason was declared elected as Hon . Secretary with Miss Dimock . At the urgent request of the Council , Miss Mason consented to remain Hon . Treasurer , pro tem . , since no one was nominated for that post . For the moment , therefore , Miss Mason holds the posts of Hon . Secretary ( Parliamentary ) and Hon . Treasurer , but she has asked the Council to look out for a successor in the treasurership . The Scottish Federation , To Scotland falls the honour of being the first of the new Federations which will soon be formed all over the country . Those who were present at the Council will remember with what indignation a Scottish delegate repudiated the word " district , " and , of course , when it is realised that some Federations may wish to cover a whole nation , the word becomes ludicrously inappropriate . The Scottish Societies have been vigorously organising and made application last week to be recognised as a Federation within the National Union . This is now done , and we welcome mest heartily this step in organisation . Miss S. E. S. Mair has been elected President ; Mr. Andrew Ballantyne , Chairman of Committee ; and Dr. Elsie Inglis , Hon . Secretary and ( pro tem . ) Hon . Treasurer ; Miss Lamond and Miss Hilliard , Organisers . The office is 2 , St. Andrew's Square , Edinburgh . The principle of federating up the Societies in certain areas is a sound one , and quite essential when work becomes complex and extensive . But if such Federation is important for geographical reasons , it is even more so when tempera- ment and national character are strongly developed , and we hope that local patriotisms may in the future stir up friendly and generous rivalries between the various Federations to be , so that the work of the National Union may be prosecuted with increased vigour . Meeting in South Salford . The Congregational Mission Hall is a large place - it seats 1,150 , and we are not the only people who have sometimes found it hard to fill . But on Wednesday , April 6th , our efforts were backed by Mrs. Philip Snowden's name and reputation . The North of England Society had her coming_well noised abroad , and the men flocked to hear her . I say men advisedly , for though there was a good sprinkling of women , it was the men who tramped in in long lines and filled bench after bench . Scarcely a man but was of the working class-

And listen they did - absorbed , as Mrs. Philip Snowden , in her marvellous way , touched their hearts , convinced their reason and drew out all that was best in them . From beginning to end there was not a sound but of applause and assent . The audience was responsive , earnest , delightful to the speakers . As one watched the faces of the crowd one could not help casting one's mind forward to the struggle upon which we may be entering before long , when we may be asking the men of South Salford to give us supreme proof of their hatred of injustice by rejecting a man who contemptuously rejects the women's claims , and by returning to the House of Commons a man pledged to put Women's Suffrage before all other questions . And as we saw their ready sympathy and their honest admission of conviction , we could not but feel a growing zest for the struggle and a growing hope of its success . MARGARET ROBERTSON . A Good Record in Leeds . I think your readers will be interested to hear the history of 108 staunch friends of our cause amongst the voters in West Leeds . Mr. Hennessey , a working - man who has done some good work for our Leeds Society , enrolled 325 men supporters in that ward into a Woman Suffrage Band . Of these , 108 Conservatives refused to vote for Mr. Samuels , the Tory candidate , because of his attitude on our position , and told him so . He visited them , we hear , for Mr. Hennessey gave him their addresses , but they stood firm , and did not vote at all . The remaining 217 voted for Mr. Harvey , though they were not very strong Radicals , on account of his supporting an Adult Suffrage which should include women . ISABELLA A. FORD .

APRIL 14 , 1910 . THE COMMON The International Women's Franchise Club Inaugural Dinner . The inaugural dinner of the International Women's Franchise Club on April 8 was a brilliant success . Just under three hundred people sat down to dinner ; Sir John Cockburn presided ; the guests at the high table included ten Members of Parliament , and representatives of the United States , Nor- way , and Hungary . There were several toasts , but only one topic ; and yet the variety of handling which that topic received from the several speakers was such that no one pre- sent could fail to find something to agree with and something to differ from . That in itself was a triumph , for the principal aim of the Club is to bring together those who for all their differences are at one in their support of the cause , to be a means of promoting that unity in essentials upon which we base our surest hope of its progress ; and therefore , although no doubt each of us liked one speaker best , yet whether we listened to Sir John Cockburn's stirring exhortation or to the old - fashioned playfulness of Sir Thomas Barclay , to Mr. J. M. Robertson's austerely philosophical admonitions or to Mr. Cecil Chapman's indignant fiery championship of those who cry for justice , there was no doubt for a moment that we were all there for the one thing , and that it was good for us to be there . SIR JOHN COCKBURN , proposing the toast of " The Guests , " began by saying that we were there because we were taking part in the greatest movement that the pages of history had yet recorded . He welcomed among us the Norwegian Consul , Herr Brekstad , the visitors from Hungary , the United States , and other lands , and those members of the British House of Commons who were with us , because they had shown that they possessed the courage of their opinions . The Suffragist he said , stood for the true spirit of representative government -for the anti - Suffrage position led straight to despotism ; that was the only conclusion logically possible from the doctrine that somebody else knew better what was good for you than yourself . Moreover , Women's Suffrage was at once the most chivalrous and the most just of all movements . The anti- Suffragist talked of chivalry , but was willing to leave the weaker sex without the protection of the one weapon that men could not dispense with for their protection . The real provokers of disturbance and enmity were not those who aimed at reform , but their opponents - snags and obstructions in the course of the stream . Women's Suffrage had been vindicated in every country that had adopted it , and its adop- tion in England would remove an absurdity and a blot from our political system . SIR THOMAS BARCLAY , responding , said that perhaps his only claim to the honour of that office was the fact that he had in 1882 written the first appeal for Women's Suffrage in French . He spoke of the success of the electors ' petition at Blackburn , and said that he was convinced that since the House of Commons was mainly a place where men talked non- sense , the introduction into it of the common - sense of women would not only knock the pomposity out of it , but compel it to save a great deal of the time now wasted in chatter . MR . J. M. ROBERTSON , following , laid stress upon his belief that the success of the movement for Women's Suffage was a matter of course ; it was inconceivable that the general prob- blem of life should be solved while one - half of those whom it concerned could take no real part in its solution . Women's Suffrage meant the civilisation of politics ; it would not effect stupendous improvements , it was not a revolutionary move- ment , but it would make society more social , and it would in the end banish from politics that malignity of partizanship which was now their curse . Mr. Robertson's philosophical outlook inclines him to patience , and a distrust of causes that come quickly to fruition . " Though you think you can't wait , you'll find that you can " ; and as he is one of the few sup- porters of the Government who , as he reminded us , retained their seats by a greatly increased majority , he can at any rate claim that much practical justification for his views ; to some of us that service which consists in standing and waiting seems inadequate . The toast of " The Cause " was proposed by MR . CECIL CHAPMAN , whose outspoken advocacy ensures him always a hearty welcome from Suffragists of every shade of opinion . He claimed that the success of the woman's cause was for the good not only of women , or of one country , but of the whole world ; it was the necessary last step in the evolution of the complete human character . The treatment of women was the one certain touchstone of any civilisation ; and the right of every woman to a personal identity of her own was the foundation of their claim . Our laws and our ideas about women could never be right under the present system . Women were said by anti - Suffragists to be " the favoured darlings of the law " ; this was nonsense , and the anti - Suffragist lived in a fool's paradise - with very little paradise in it . Neither Christianity nor democracy was doing enough for women ; the Church still authorised the degrading conception of the obedient man - worshipping wife ; and the democracy offered the same opposition to women's aims to - day as it had to the struggles of women in the past to be educated , to own pro- perty , to control their children , to improve their condition in every respect . All the progress that had been made was due

CAUSE . 9 to the struggle of the women themselves . He referred to the treatment experienced by Mrs. Josephine Butler in her fifteen years ' crusade against abominable laws . A meeting was once held in honour of Mrs. Butler's achievement ; it was marked by religious fervour and deep emotion . An American woman who was there said afterwards : " Yes , prayers are good , and tears are good , but a vote behind every tear would be still better . " The State ought to be an extended home ; it never could be until women had a voice in legislation ; not until then could we realise Wordsworth's vision of A perfect woman , nobly planned , To warn , to comfort , and command . MR . PHILIP SNOWDEN , responding , introduced a fresh note of optimism , rather by way , as he confessed , of antidote to Mr. Robertson's philosophy . No cause , he declared , had ever gone ahead so well as the cause of Woman's Suffrage had in the last ten years , and no great movement was now nearer fruition . The support of members of the House of Commons was a totally different thing ; no member now dared to present a petition for Women's Suffrage by dropping it into a bag behind the Speaker's chair , if he meant to face his constituency again . As for tactics , he had always held that they were the affair of the women , and not for him to criticise ; but he did not believe that supporters had been alienated by tactics , although opponents had found in them an excuse for opposing . The position to - day was very much more favourable than it had ever been before . HERR BREKSTAD , Consul for Norway , following , said that it was common to hear of a man protesting that there was no sacrifice that he would not willingly make for some woman- even his life he was ready to give . Yet he would not give her a vote . Those who feared that women would vote for the wrong side deserved their fears , for their neglect of women's interests was responsible for them . In Norway , the first occasion on which women exercised the Parliamentary franchise was three years ago ; it had made no difference to the balance of parties , but in Norway the reform had been easier to introduce because the relations between man and wife , especially in the peasant class , were better than in most countries ; the woman was more independent and more freely consulted . Only one member had opposed its introduction ; none would now go back . MR . G. H. RADFORD proposed the toast of " The Club , " drawing attention to its value as an international institution , and congratulating it on a membership of 700 so early in its life . MRS . PHILIP SNOWDEN , responding , entirely falsified her own declaration that she could not make an after - dinner speech . She is one of those speakers whose earnestness is always inspiring , and whose wit is never mere wit , because it is always the weapon of her faith . She claimed for the Club that it stood for the spirit of universal brotherhood and sister- hood , and for the Cause that it must win the support even of every party man , if he knew why he belonged to his party . Once we could get below labels , as Mr. Balfour had said , the truth must prevail . A cause is surely winning as soon as men have become able to define it . The vote , however , is only the beginning . Blake's lines must be our motto : - " I will not cease from mental fight , Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand , Till we have built Jerusalem In England's green and pleasant land . " MR . GOLDFINCH BATE , honorary treasurer of the Club , also responded , laying stress upon the value of developing the social side of the movement . The health of the Chairman was proposed by Mr. R. P. CHOLMELEY , and seconded by MRS . ANDREW NEESON , a former president of the Society of American Women in London , who expressed a hope that when Sir John Cockburn had seen the women's cause successful in England he would come over and help them to win in the United States . Among the company , besides those already named , were Mr. John Ward , M.P. , Mr. John Hodge , M.P. ( who was unfor- tunately prevented by the lateness of the hour from staying to propose the chairman's health ) , Mr. Munro , M.P. , Mr. A. H. Scott , M.P. , Mr. Muspratt , M.P. , and Mr. W. P. Byles , M.P. That veteran of the cause , Mrs. Stopes , was with us . Lady Cockburn supported Sir John ; most of the M.P.'s brought or were brought by their wives . At least six European countries were represented at the high table and elsewhere . We had to regret the absence of Mrs. Despard , who sent a friendly message ; of Mr. W. H. Dickinson , M.P. , obliged to be out of London ; and Mr. Sherwell , M.P. , who at the last moment was too unwell to come ; and ill - health most unfortunately deprived us of the chairman of the Club Committee , Mr. C. A. V. Conybeare , to whose energetic labours the success of the Club is very largely due . No account of the dinner can be complete without a tribute to the invaluable work done by Miss Cicely Corbett , the honorary secretary , and Miss Rosalind Gray Hill , assistant secretary , who had to grapple with the organisation of a function which seemed at first likely to be a modest dinner of 60 or 70 , and grew in a few days to a banquet of nearly 300. It remains to be said that the Press in general gave quite appreciative notices .

10 THE COMMON The Actresses ' Franchise League . The monthly invitation " At Home " of the Actresses ' Franchise League was held on Friday , April 1st , in the King's Hall , Criterion Restaurant , and was very largely attended . Miss Fanny Brough was a mirth - provoking chairwoman , and opened the proceedings with a witty and amusing speech . Lawrence Housman spoke emphatically on the economic side of the woman's question , attributing the whole problem of race degeneration to the baneful effect of moral pressure with regard to marriage . Miss Compton's telling speech was punctuated with a series of relevant anecdotes that kept the audience vastly amused ; while Mr. Hugh Law , Miss Abdam , and Mrs. Russell emphasised from their various standpoints , and each with equal conviction , the justice and humanity of their common cause . Troublesome Questions . MARGERY ( aged 19 ) . HER FATHER . MARGERY : Why doesn't Cyril Taylor live with his own father and mother , father ? FATHER : Well , you see , his father isn't a suitable person to be the child's guardian - drinks , and all that - wife left him . MARGERY : And isn't she a nice woman ? FATHER : Of course she is ; she's allowed to see the child every now and then once a term , I believe . MARGERY : Once a term ! Why doesn't he spend his holidays with her , instead of at school ? FATHER : Well , you see , his aunt is his guardian , and she can't have him at home ; she's always ill . MARGERY : And so that poor baby of nine spends his holidays at a boarding school ! It's not fair . FATHER : My dear , you don't understand ; it's a question of the property . The money came from his father's people , not his mother's , and they appointed their daughter guardian ; most natural ! MARGERY : And is that allowed ? How ridiculous the law is ! Why , only the other day they were forcing married teachers to give up work and spend every moment of their lives with their babies - whether they had them or not while this woman is allowed to see hers three times a year , because her husband is such a brute it isn't safe for her or the child to live with him ! FATHER ( coldly ) : Really , Margery , it's none of my business , nor yours ! Miss Horniman's Theatre . One had the feeling of a good many loose ends about the new play produced this week by Miss Horniman's company . ** Subsidence " is the title , and the theme is the collapse of a man's farm and with it the house in which Lythgoes have lived for two hundred years and more , the old farmer , last of the Lythgoes ' name , obstinately refusing even to take the price of the coal which is being quarried beneath his foundations , and which will assuredly ruin his farm whether he takes pay for it or no , is the most interesting character , in the direct line of succession from Farmer Fleming . Like Fleming , too , he has no son , and while lamenting this , treats his one daughter as a mere chattel , to be offered or withheld at his will . He intends her for one man , and she chooses another , and the words of her revolt when he claims her filial duty are well conceived . There seems a promise , too , of a really fine tragedy when , at the end of the second act , the old man asserts his bullying authority over the desperate girl , and in some ways the last act , full of shuddering fear , is the best . The girl , who has morally , at least , been guilty of her father's murder and has egged on her feeble lover to a half - hearted felony , is shown at last , crumbling to her doom , like the house and farm . Miss Louise Holbrook's fine performance of the quavering old servant , half apprehending " subsidences " of more than one kind , gave well the horror of strange and limitless catastrophes . " Unto One of the Least of These . " If to - night He stood before me , No credential in His hand , Homeless , poor , despised , unfriended ,. Alien in an alien land ; If He said " The joys I offer Ask surrender of thine all : Take thy cross , arise and follow " - Should I answer to the call ? Yet we dream , in wistful moments , When the glare of day is dim , That our heart's extreme of coldness Is but cold for lack of Him . Might we face to face behold Thee , As of old on plain or hill , Feel the sunshine of Thy presence , Thou should'st know us children still . "

To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , May I very shortly endeavour to remove one apprehension with regard to this scheme ? The idea is that each person would collect 6d . from ten others , " personally known , " and would transmit the resulting 5s . to the N.U. hon . treasurer direct for the Suffrage Candidates ' Election Fund . By this means I think no fraud could arise . It is also an easier matter to obtain 6d . than to persuade an acquaintance to canvass ten others , so that I should advise acceptance of that sum from those willing to give , and the continuance of the search for the more active canvasser until the number is complete . - Yours , EDITH S. HOOPER . Chenies Street Chambers , W.C. MUNICIPAL AND PARLIAMENTARY FRANCHISE . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , Your comment on B. E. H.'s letter of last week states that over 80 per cent . of the women who would get the Parliamentary vote " on the same terms as men " would be working - women . The calculation you quote was made on the basis of the municipal , not the Parliamentary , franchise . Nobody knows how many women would get the vote if women had the Parliamentary franchise on present terms . The " two million " is a mere guess . Nor does anyone know how many of them would belong to the working - class . I do not quite understand your saying that every woman would be a potential voter under this form of enfranchise- ment . Any woman might become a voter if she were rich enough ; but it is quite certain that every woman could not . Married working - women , shop assistants , domestic servants , and almost all factory girls could not get the vote unless they were raised above their present economic and industrial conditions , when , of course , they would not so much need it . Among the municipal voters working - women are in large majority . They are largely elderly widows , and not at all typical of the working - class as a whole , as any of your readers who have canvassed among them will know . The additional voters under the Parliamentary franchise would belong almost entirely to the propertied class , and no one knows how many they would be . This correction with regard to the percentage of working- women has been made publicly so often that surely the

APRIL 14 , 1910 . THE COMMON Women's Suffrage Societies ought not to persist in using the figures wrongly . If we begin the enfranchisement of women by giving the vote either " on the same terms as men " or to the present municipal voters , the political influence of Labour will undoubtedly lose ground . In Woolwich , for instance , all but a very small minority of the women's municipal vote is anti - Labour . People who are not inter- ested in politics or do not sympathise with Labour may see no objection to dealing it a blow , while they establish the political rights of women as a matter of abstract theory , regardless of the political effect on the cause of the poor- women as well as men . But some of us believe that the help of the law can be of very great value to working - women . We prefer to work for adult suffrage , as the only technically practicable form of enfranchisement that will give real political power to women of the working - class , while doing justice to women of other classes . - Yours , ROSALIND NASH . As I am writing , may I say that an unauthorised " star has somehow fallen into the little verses you kindly printed last week ? 23 22 33 [ When we said " every woman would be a potential voter we meant that there would be no absolute bar as there now is , and you could not tell , by merely looking at her , as you now can , that a woman was politically negligible . The calculation referred to was made , as Mrs. Nash states , on the basis of the municipal franchise , and was not intended to be anything but approximate . Most of the women enfran- chised on the same terms " would , we think , be occupiers ; the service vote would be almost non - existent , and the lodger vote could not be regarded as a " rich property or a woman's " vote except by a strange perversion of language . As to the creation of faggot votes , or plural votes , by rich men , we see little sign that rich men would be willing to add such importance to their women ; we wish we could ; what might be lost for progress in one direction would be gained for it in another . But then we have a very different stand- point from Mrs. Nash . She is thinking of how women will vote ; we are thinking of how women are to be soonest acknowledged to be human beings . We regret very much the vexatious misprint in the verses so kindly sent us last week ; the fourth line of the second verse should , of course , run " And the slow days were dear . " - ED . , C.C. " ] PARLIAMENT AND WOMAN SUFFRAGE . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , The paragraph entitled " A Rumoured Bill , " in your issue of the 31st ult . , raises a serious question as to the attitude which suffragists intend to adopt towards any attempt to " take the wind " out of their movement . Those of us who have had much to do with professed politicians , know that , while the people of the country are mostly sympathetic to the Woman Suffrage cause ( when they assume an attitude at all ) , the real opposition , disguised though it may be , exists in Parliamentary and related circles , always excepting the very few men there who have con- sistently upheld women's rights . I take it , therefore , that the rumour as to a possible Bill on the basis of the present municipal franchise is simply a non - committal political feeler thrown out , as the House of Commons in its club capacity knows well how to do , in order to disorganise the suffrage ranks on the vital principle of the movement . The fact that this is not a " party " question , while it reads well on paper and sounds well to the ear , only adds to the practical difficulties of women so long as they are unen- franchised and so long as any woman can be found in Primrose Leagues or Liberal Federations . It should never be forgotten that a " party " question is merely one that , aside from its merits , has been officially taken up by the leader of a party . A non - party question is only advantageous from the point of view of the voting classes ; it is a disadvantage , even when it is a necessity , to non - voters until a distinct and successful agitation for it has been created . Nothing , however , could be further from my desire than to recommend suffragists to affiliate to any Parliamentary section , but I feel bound to warn them that there are grave dangers ahead , including the possible collapse of the move- ment , if after the past four years ' struggle they weaken , even slightly , with regard to their just and logical demand for the vote " on the same terms as it is or may be granted to men . " Yours , CHARLES B. MABON . 50 , St. George's Road , Glasgow , April 5 , 1910 .

" Madam , As the sender of Mrs. Lloyd George's letter asks for comment on her statement in the current " Common Cause , " and as you say you are not inclined to make any that really bears on the point , I should like to offer a com- ment which is distinctly pertinent - namely , that this state-

The militant tactics began on October 14th , 1905 , and the majority on Mr. Stanger's Bill was obtained on February 28th , 1908 , or nearly two and a half years later . With what accuracy , then , can Mrs. Lloyd George say that this majority was obtained " before the Suf- fragettes started their unconstitutional methods " ? I scarcely know which surprises me more - that she should make such a glaring misstatement or that you should not contradict it.- Yours , etc. , THEODORA MILLS , Hon . Secretary , Cheltenham , W.S.S.

WOMEN'S AMBITIONS . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , Agda Adelgren in her letter in last week's issue seems to compliment herself on having put her finger on the weak spot . To my mind the line of argument in both her letters is weak in the extreme . What she asks of women before the vote should be granted to them is equivalent to refusing to engage anyone in any capacity until they can prove fitness to occupy such position , whilst debarring them from gaining the necessary experience . She evidently expects women to compete with men on equal terms , under most unequal opportunities . Was it expected of the agri- cultural labourer , earning as low a wage as nine shillings per week ( according to the testimony of the late Mr. Henry Fawcett , who fought so bravely in his day for the extension of the franchise to the working - classes ) that he should show equal intelligence and ability with those of better education and opportunity ? When the question of the extension of the franchise was under discussion in the House of Commons , the late Mr. W. E. Gladstone was told that the agricultural labourer did not want the vote . " No ! " said Mr. Gladstone , " the men may not want the vote , but the country wants the men . " Can it not be urged with equal truth that the country at the present time sorely needs the help of women ? Quoting from Agda Adelgren's last letter , she says : " My words , why does not woman earn ? etc , " were not exactly put interro- gatively , but to draw attention to facts , and I at once got the desired reply - inability . This I consider a gross insult to the majority of women workers ( professional and otherwise ) , as they are not paid in accordance with ability , but in most cases according to sex . Then Agda Adelgren goes on to say : - " But it seem to me absolutely inadequate , not to say preposterous , that women who live on men's earnings ( accumulated or otherwise ) should clamour for political rights . " What , I ask this correspon- dent , about the men ( and , unfortunately , there are too many ) who live upon women's earnings ( accumulated or otherwise ) , who are allowed the privilege , without having to clamour for political rights ? It is Agda Adelgren , in my opinion , who is trying to put the cart before the horse , and her arguments only go to prove the tremendous need there is of women being given the power of the vote , not only to safeguard their own interests , but also to bring about a better condition of things for both MARY SLEE . sexes . 54 , Lowther Street , Carlisle .

BIRMINGHAM - WEST BROMWICH . A most successful At Home , the first of its kind , was held on April 7th in the Free Library . The chair was admirably taken by Mrs. Langley Browne , to whose zeal and enthusiasm the meeting was due . A large audience listened with attention to the speeches of Miss Gardner and Mrs. Mayer . All our " Common Causes " were sold , and several new members were obtained . It is hoped that a West Bromwich Branch of the National Union will shortly be formed as a result of this meeting and Mrs. Mayer's admirable work . BIRMINGHAM - WOLVERHAMPTON . By the kindness of Mrs. Marsh , of The Leylands , Penn , a very successful drawing - room meeting was held on the afternoon of April 8th , Mrs. Arnold Shaw presiding . Miss Lumsden , the speaker , who has given much of her time and thought and means to the cause of woman's education and advancement , gave a most interesting and enthusiastic address on the need for the removal of the sex dis- ability . She very ably attacked the Anti - Suffragist arguments , showing , with reference to physical force , that not the strongest men are of value , but the trained men . Now , the great forces are She showed that in all the moral , intellectual , and economic . of these women can ably take their part . The attendance was good , literature and badges were sold , and several new members were enrolled . BURTON . This Society's meeting at Friars ' Walk Schools on Wednesday afternoon , April 6th , proved a great success . Mrs. Roger Green took the chair , supported by the President and Hon . Secretary of the Society and a number of well - known local ladies . The audience was a large and representative one , including the Mayoress of Burton and many other influential ladies , and great interest was evinced in the proceedings . Miss Gardner , B.A. , gave a powerful and eloquent address on " Women's Suffrage and National Purity , " at the close of which discussion took place . At the later adjournment for tea many non - Suffrage visitors expressed to the Suffrage officials warm thanks for the valuable educative opportunity afforded them . new members fair amount of Suffrage literature was sold , some were booked , and many sympathizers gained . A very fair collection Excellent was taken , which will probably cover the expenses . reports of the proceedings ( so far as reportable ) were secured in the local Press . A The next venture of the Burton Women's Suffrage Society will be a debate on May 2nd , in the same rooms , when the Society's President , Mrs. Sadler , will meet Mr. Rawlings , delegate from the I.L.P. , to discuss " Women's Suffrage v . Adult Suffrage . " CHELTENHAM . Two meetings were arranged on the request of the Ladies ' National Association for the Abolition of the State Regulation of Vice , Dr. Helen Wilson , of Sheffield , being the speaker . The first was by invitation to members and a few friends , and was held on Wednesday afternoon , April 6th , at Sandford Lawn , by invitation of General and Mrs. Swiney . Between sixty and seventy ladies assem- bled , the room being full . Mrs. Swiney herself took the chair , alluding to the life - work of Josephine Butler . Dr. Wilson then spoke , outlining some of the chief aspects of the problem of prostitution , the title of her address being , " Women's Suffrage and the Social Evil . " Those present listened with deep interest , and at the close there was some discussion . A bookstall provided ample literature , " M.A.P.'s " and publications of the L.N.A. being sold . A vote of thanks was proposed and seconded by Mrs. S. Wilson , M.B. , and Mrs. How Earengey , B.A. , and tea was served . On the following day a public evening meeting was held in the Town Hall Supper - room , when about 250 to 300 people gathered . The Rector of Cheltenham ( Rev. L'Estrange Fawcett ) took the chair and made a strong and outspoken speech . Dr. Helen Wilson then described " The White Slave Traffic , " illustrating its evils , mentioning what was being done to check it , and pointing out what still required to be done in the shape of education and the tightening up " of the law . She moved a resolution calling upon the Government to take action along these lines . This was briefly seconded by the Rev. Harris Jones and carried unanimously . A vote of thanks to the speaker and the chairman was moved by Dr. Grace Stewart - Billings , who said the possession of the vote would help women to raise the moral standard . Councillor W. G. Earengey , LL.D. ( Men's League ) , seconded , touching upon the difficulty of securing a satisfactory international law to deal with the traffic . Dr. Wilson was supported on the platform , besides those already named , by Mrs. Swiney ( President W.S.S. ) , Mr. J. Beale Ransford ( Guardian ) , Mrs. S. Wilson , M.B. , and Miss Heath ( both W.S.S. Committee ) . A collection of about Â£ 3 was taken , and " Common Causes , " M.A.P.'s " and other literature were sold . EDINBURGH . Monday was a day given up to Committee meetings . The Organizing Committee met at ten , the Committee in connection with Mrs. Snowden's May meeting at 2.30 , and the Executive at 4.30 . We have already got our tickets ready for Mrs. Snowden's meeting and they will be on sale at our offices , 40 , Shandwick Place ; at Patrick Thomson , North Bridge , and at Pentland , Frederick Street . Both Mr. Pentland and Mr. Gardiner ( the manager of Thomson's ) have been unfailing in their kindness to our Society , and we take this opportunity of acknowledging it . We shall have as many tickets as possible sold privately , as in this way we touch a fresh section of the community . The meeting is specially arranged to suit members of the Assembly of the Church of Scotland and their friends , and we hope that they will not miss this opportunity of hearing one of our finest speakers . Mrs. Jack's drawing - room meeting was most delightful , and Dr. Elsie Inglis and Miss Matheson covered a great part of the ground in their speeches . An appeal for funds from Dr. Inglis was most successful , five pounds being subscribed to the Edinburgh Society and

On Friday Mrs. Joseph Dobbie gave an excellent lecture on " Women and Scots Law both at the afternoon and evening meetings . In the afternoon Miss Lees took the chair , and was as amusing as she always is . Mrs. Dobbie handled the difficult subject of Scottish law with great skill and accurate knowledge , and the audience listened with the greatest attention and interest to an address of more than an hour . Mrs. Dobbie pointed out that the law of Scotland was very much fairer to women than the law of England - viz . , in the divorce laws , which are absolutely the same for both sexes ; but that in other respects there is still much to be desired . The disabilities apply , as a rule , to married women . Although the Married Women's Property Act 1882 did much for married women , still they are unable to dispose of their own capital or land without their husband's consent . Where the shoe pinches most is when the woman becomes a mother , because then she finds that she has no real power over her own children , that their father is the only parent in the eye of the law . Mrs. Dobbie gave several instances of a very convincing nature from the law reports , and one felt that it would help the cause immensely if every Suffrage speaker took as much trouble to be accurate as she did . The attendance at the evening meeting was smaller than that in the afternoon , but all who came were strangers who seemed pleased and promised to return . Several foreigners appeared , and a Hun- garian clergyman was highly delighted to see our colours , which he said were the colours of Hungary . FILEY . On April 1st and 2nd two successful amateur performances of " How the Vote was Won " were given in the Church Infant School by members of the above Society . A non - Suffrage play was also per- formed , and the proceeds were equally divided between the Suffrage Society and the Clothing Club . These were the only terms on which we could obtain the school , which is the only building available for theatricals in Filey , and we thought we took more money than if the performance had been solely for the Suffrage . The school was well filled on both evenings by appreciative audiences . The programme - sellers and stewards wore badges of the colours . Good notices were inserted in the local Press . GLOUCESTER . A well - attended meeting under the auspices of the Gloucester Women's Suffrage Society was held at Northgate Mansions_on Wednesday evening , April 6th , when Miss Bertha Mason , Hon .. Treasurer of the N.U.W.S.S. , lectured on " Forty Years ' Work for Women's Suffrage . " She illustrated what she said by means of lantern slides , consisting of portraits of the pioneers of the move- ment , both men and women , and also of slides representing scenes from some of the large women's processions , open - air meetings and caravan tours organized by the N.U.W.S.S. The meeting was well reported in the local papers , and was ably presided over by Dr. Elizabeth Sloan Chesser , who , after reading apologies for absence from the Mayor and other well - known local names , made some encouraging remarks on the progress of the movement all over the country . It is hoped that Miss Bertha Mason's most interesting lecture , and her appeal to the men present to throw aside prejudice and help to forward women's demand , not for a favour but for a long- delayed measure of justice , may lead to greater interest in the local Society and possibly the formation of a branch of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage . HERTS . , NORTH . Through the kindness of Mrs. Holden , of Harmer Green , a very interesting drawing - room meeting was held at her house on the after- noon of April 5th , when Dr. Marion Phillips , late Secretary to the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , gave an address on the general aspect of the subject of Women's Suffrage , and some practical advice to affiliated Societies . She pointed out that , as women saw more clearly than men , in some cases , the need of reforms , it would be to the general advantage to have their co - operation in obtaining such , especially in legislation affecting women and children . She urged every woman , while contrasting the improved conditions of many of their sex with those of an earlier date , not to sit still , but by example and precept to encourage each other in every effort to secure the same for all , and to seek by obtaining their own share of direct responsibility to help forward civilization in its true sense - the forming of public opinion for the betterment of the community . It was a matter of regret that , owing to the unavoidably short notice , not more than half those invited were able to attend . A hearty vote of thanks to Miss Phillips and Mrs. Holden concluded a most enjoyable afternoon . HERTS . , WEST . On Thursday an address on the history of the Suffrage movement was given by Mrs. Robinson ( Hon . Secretary ) at the Masonic Hall , Watford . This was the first of a series of meetings which we hope to hold during the next two months . The audience seemed interested in the subject of the address , and some of them have since requested that another address be given dealing more fully with the later developments of the movement . The local Press again gave us a generous report . It rests with us now to supply the Press with interesting " copy , " for by inserting , without comment , all that is best in our efforts , it is allowing us to speak for ourselves , and doing us thus the kindliest service . Miss M. Corbett speaks at a drawing - room meeting in Bushey on April 19th . People want to know there what practical use the vote will be to women . They readily admit that a change for the better in the status of women is badly needed . How will the vote help ? On the 21st , in Watford , Miss Campbell , chairman of our Com- mittee , will speak on " Woman Suffrage and the Social Evil . " Miss Abadam has already begun to stimulate the interest of the Watford women in this question ; but there is a great amount of deadly apathy with regard to the matter to be contended with . It is looked upon as that most illogical and immoral of all the vain imaginings of the human mind - a " necessary evil , " a " regrettable

LONDON - WINDSOR AND ETON . An enthralled audience listened with delight to a racy address on Lady McLaren's Women's Charter from Mrs. Stanbury on Wednes- day , April 6th , at 6 , Clarence Crescent , Windsor . The hostesses , the Misses Hodgskin , very kindly lent their house to the branch for the annual meeting of members . When this was concluded tea was served , and then the members and others had the pleasure of hearing Mrs. Stanbury speak . She realized that her audience were not beginners , so did not deal with the A.B.C. of Women's Suffrage , but gave a most interesting discourse on the reasons for and against the Charter . Mrs. B. S. C. Everett was in the chair . A good collection was taken at the close of the meeting . LONDON NORTH HACKNEY . This Committee is arranging to hold a public meeting in the Library Hall , Church Street , Stoke Newington , on Thursday , April 28th , at 8 p.m. At the time of the General Election about 1,240 men voters in North Hackney signed the Women's Suffrage petition , and it was found then that many would be interested to know more about the subject . Since the election we have succeeded in getting sixty more names , bringing our number of signatures up to 1,300 , and have gained ten new members . Councillor White , B.A. , LL.D. , has kindly consented to take the chair at one meeting , and will be supported by our M.P. , Mr. Raymond Greene , if his Parliamentary duties permit . The speakers will be Miss Margaret Hodge , Miss Edith Palliser , the Rev. Dr. R. ( St. Ethelburga's , Within Bishopsgate , and Mr. F. Cholmeley , from the Men's League for Women's Suffrage . NORTH EASTERN SOCIETY . Cobb The annual meeting of this Society was held on Saturday afternoon in the Drawing - room CafÃ© , Newcastle , when , in spite of the weather , there was an excellent audience of members and sympathizers , many of whom joined after the meeting . The Committee considered that the title " North Eastern " would be the fitting name for the Federation of the Societies in Northumberland and Durham , and their suggestion that the North Eastern Society should henceforth be known as the " Newcastle - on - Tyne Society for Women's Suffrage was adopted . The report of the Committee and the statement of the General Fund showed the Society to be in a very flourishing condition . Mrs. Dunn , who acted as Treasurer during the election , reported , however , that the expenditure had amounted to Â£ 90 , and only Â£ 70 had been subscribed to the Special Election Fund , leaving a deficit of Â£ 20 . Dr. Ethel Williams made an appeal from the chair , and Â£ 12 was quickly raised - a most encouraging and healthy sign . Miss Frances Hardcastle was unanimously appointed Treasurer in the place of Mrs. Wilkinson , who has retired in consequence of ill - health . Miss Mein gave an account of the annual meeting of the National Union , and Dr. Williams explained the new election policy , which seemed to attract everyone . By Appointment .

CAUSE , 13 Exceptional interest has been manifested in the election of the Guardians of the city in consequence of the unusually large number of women candidates . We are pleased to say that two prominent members of our Society were successful - Miss Buchanan , who is an old member of the Board , and Miss Ericsson , who had the assistance of several fellow - Suffragists and members of a Working Girls ' Club , in which she is especially interested . She attained the fourth place in a list of sixteen candidates for eight seats . We feel sure she will prove as good a Guardian as she is a Suffragist . NORTH OF ENGLAND . Eight members of this Society and four gay and fluttering flags took part in the rally on Friday evening . Mr Cooper kindly acted as chairman and introduced the speakers . Miss K. Jones , Mrs. MÃ¼ter Wilson , and Miss Walshe gave short addresses . They dealt chiefly with the position of women in the industrial world . A woman in the crowd was heard to exclaim : " What the ladies say is quite true , " and a man asked if there would be a meeting next Friday , as he wanted to come again . The crowd was a large and an orderly one . Literature was distributed and " Common Causes " sold . We intend these rallies to go on in South Salford every Friday evening for the present . We are gradually becoming known and trusted , and the splendid meeting at the Mission Hall ( notoriously difficult to fill ) was a good omen for our conversion of the electorate . NORTH OF ENGLAND BURY . A new branch of the North of England Society was inaugurated at a public meeting held in Bury , April 4th , at which Councillor Margaret Ashton and Mrs. Philip Snowden were the chief speakers . Bury has enjoyed , up to the present , the reputation of being extremely difficult to rouse , but to judge from Monday's meeting Mrs. Snowden has succeeded where others have failed . Her speech , which was lucid and moderate , made a deep impression on her audience . Both she and Miss Ashton will receive a very hearty welcome whenever they repeat their visit . The Society begins with forty - eight members on the rolls . NORTH OF ENGLAND - RADCLIFFE - CUM - FARNWORTH . We had a very successful social in Radcliffe Drill Hall on Saturday evening , though the numbers did not come up to our expectations . About sixty sat down to tea , and forty more came afterwards . After tea Miss S. Allan , of Radcliffe , gave a bright little address which was much appreciated . The rest of the evening was spent in dancing , interspersed with music and games . All present expressed a wish that this should become an annual affair . Eight new members joined . OLTON . The annual public meeting of this Society was held on April 5th . Mr. Chas . Husband occupied the chair . Mrs. Mayer , of Australia , was the speaker , and her subject was , " Women's Suffrage : An Accomplished Fact in Australasia . " The strength of Mrs. Mayer's arguments depends on her excellent arrangement and quite simple statement of facts . She urges her hearers to think Imperially ; she shows how her nation , thinking Imperially , influences Imperially , by her model social reforms ; and acts Imperially by help in time The of war , and by gifts of " Dreadnoughts " in times of peace . mother nation has no daughter so completely filial as the nation whose women are free as her men - where sex warfare has ceased by reason of the granting of the vote . There were a number of ill - mannered youths in the audience . The real disturbers , however , were speedily escorted outside by the stewards . At question time two young men , of the age of those who usually disturb meetings in more or less senseless fashion , stood up and vigorously challenged several of the speaker's state- ments , and asked questions in all seriousness . At the end of a very lively discussion , with not a little heat on the part of the young men , one declared he was almost a Suffragette . " We are hoping before Mrs. Mayer's campaign is finished he will be quite a " Suffragist . " Not a Suffragist in the audience but felt grateful for those two young men , standing up manfully amid their com- panions to display interest in and show respect for the women's cause . If the present voters fail us , the future will not . PLYMOUTH . Public meetings have been held at the Corn Exchange , Plymouth , and The Welcome , Devonport . At both meetings Miss Helen Fraser spoke , and her speeches received the closest attention . She moved a resolution which was seconded by Dr. Mabel L. Ramsay . Both the local papers reported the meeting well , and the " Western Daily Mercury " in particular quoted in extenso , and headed it , " Women's Politics and the Law : A Striking Address at Plymouth , " and it also devoted four paragraphs of its leaderettes . Deponent sayeth not how many men listened to Miss Helen Fraser's speech at Plymouth last night . If their number was large there must infallibly be a great accession of strength to the Suffrage movement in the Three Towns . Miss Fraser's incisive manner , her resistless logic , and her large views must have convinced the grumpiest anti - feminist . We verily believe that even Mr. St. Loe Strachey's complacency would have been disturbed - though we admit it seems a far - fetched thing to say if he could have heard Miss Fraser's merciless satire upon his pet argument ' against women's enfranchisement - viz . , ' Men are men ; women are women ; therefore women cannot be allowed to vote . " The Editor of the " Mercury " was present , hence our good report . A drawing - room meeting was held by Mrs. Marwood , and those present listened with great attention to Miss Fraser . On Tuesday , April 5th , came the disappointment of the series , for at Devonport we had hoped to have had a great meeting , and we only mustered something over one hundred . At all meetings Miss Fraser excelled , and we felt that she deserved a far larger audience than had been secured . It is borne in on us that greater efforts must be made and more people reached by personal contact . " At the meetings several new members were secured , and " Common Causes were sold . We now hope to organize a month's campaign very shortly . PORTSMOUTH . The last meeting of the Debating Circle took place at " The Cottage , " Cosham , on Saturday , 9th . Unfortunately , Miss Hooper , who should have supported the resolution , " That the freedom of

14 THE married women to work for payment should not be restricted law , " was not able to be present ; but her paper was read by Guille . Miss Hooper dealt chiefly with the case of women and women working in the factory , and stated that at one she had been in favour of limiting a married woman's right work , but the Women's Charter had put facts before her which very much modified and altered her opinion . Miss Donohue read thoughtful paper against the resolution , pleading for better ments for the homes of the nation before the mothers could be as wage - earners outside . The discussion was very keen and the resolution was carried , Miss Newbiggin's point - that any attempt to legislate on this before the enfranchisement of women was not to be tolerated - loudly cheered . TUNBRIDGE WELLS .. On April 6th , by the kind invitation of Sir William and Miss we had an afternoon drawing - room meeting and tea , for members at Kilmore , Broadwater Down . From various causes - the and extended Easter holidays - the attendance was smaller than anticipated . Our President , Madame Sarah Grand , gave a address , urging members to show more energy and to endeavour increase the growth of the Society by each individual securing fresh recruit . She deprecated the " deadly earnestness " that often characterized women's meetings , and a tendency not to that conveyed an impression of irresponsiveness . She illustrated handling of the subject in a lighter vein by relating anecdotes elicited both laughter and applause . Mrs. Upton Davis and Mrs. Mackintosh , our delegates to recent Council meeting in London , both gave us interesting graphic accounts of it . We shall be glad to join in a federation and to correspond with our neighbours on the matter . The establish- ment of a permanent committee - room or office as a rallying point members who are widely scattered was discussed . Madame Grand moved a vote of sympathy with the Hon . Secretary Mrs. Tattershall Dodd , on her long convalescence , which cordially endorsed . All communications must still be addressed Miss Moseley , 55 , Grosvenor Park . YORKSHIRE ORGANIZATION - WAKEFIELD . A very successful and well - attended public meeting has been in the Music Saloon on Friday , the 8th . Mrs. Grosvenor who had promised to preside , was at the last moment prevented illness from coming to help us , but Dr. Mary Phillips , of the Society , most kindly consented at a moment's notice to take place , and the Wakefield Society owes her a debt of gratitude such sympathetic help . She was supported on the platform members of the local Committee and Mrs. Thornton ( Leeds Secretary ) . Miss A. Maude Royden made a most stirring convincing speech , explaining the policy and aims of the Union , and showing how our civilization was warped and one - by the woman's point of view being omitted from our Council . We were very sorry that Miss Fielden , being unwell , only able to give us a short speech , supporting the resolution , was carried by a large majority , only three voting against Twenty - six new members joined , an excellent collection was and many " Common Causes were sold .

CAUSE . Whispers of Fashion 15 are never accepted by the Manufacturers of the Royal Worcester Kid - fitting Corsets . They prefer to rely always on the Facts about Fashion obtained by their responsible agents , who are in the confidence of the absolute Dictators of the Mode and are present at their earliest fashion conferences , when the styles to be adopted on the Eve of a New Season are fully considered and finally accepted . Thus the interests of the Parisian Couturiers are served by the corset geniuses who design the new season's Royal Worcester Kid - fitting Models , on the absolutely correct lines necessary to faithfully convey the artistic intent of the Paris Fashion Makers . WORCESTER CORSETS The above sketch is not exaggerated , but is a faithful representation of the actual Corset .
