We take the hardest work upon ourselves , and no good and just woman can complain of want of consideration , legally or socially . " This good gentleman , fresh from the exhilarating task of " weighing up women , is shocked by " M.A.'s " statement that children and housing are women's questions ; she exhibits " a strain of self - assertion which it is not pleasant to behold , " and he adds that he discusses " these women's matters , of which ' M.A. ' so glibly speaks , ' with his wife and daughters , and " the advice of ' M.A. , ' or any woman who has studied at Girton , Oxford , or Cambridge , is of no importance to me .

414 THE COMMON The People's Federation and the Women's Co - operative Guild . The late president of the Women's Co - operative Guild , Mrs. Bury , who made such an excellent speech last year at the great Suffrage meeting in the Free Trade Hall , has written an interesting letter to the " Co - operative News " deprecating the inference that the whole of the Co- operative Guild may be taken as backing the new Federa- tion . As far as we have heard from co - operators them- selves , the delegates have not been asked to vote upon the question whether they wished to join this Federation ; " academic " resolu- their voting at Oldham was for an tion , and before the Federation had taken form . Executive of the Guild has joined the Federation apparently , but this surely does not mean that the 25,000 members of the Guild may be taken as endorsing the views of the Federation . More Light on the Marriage Tax . The In a recent leader in the " Times we may see plainly how hard the suggested taxes hit married people as com- pared to single . A has an income , " says the Times , " " of £ 200 a year , and in consequence of its smallness he B has an income of is asked to pay only 15s . per cent . £ 400 a year , and the extra two hundred are supposed to make his shoulders so much broader that he has to pay 45s . per cent . Instead of paying double what A has to pay he is charged six times as much . " Now the case is precisely the same if A , with £ 200 a year , marries B , with £ 200 a year , because , though there are two people living on £ 400 instead of two living on £ 200 each , the wife's £ 200 is added to the husband's £ 200 , and the total made liable to 45s . per cent . Two bachelors might have lived together and only paid 15s . per cent . each . Where there are children the case becomes still harder , for the bonus on children goes a very little way indeed . These objections are of the nature that Mr. Lloyd - George calls " sentimental . " One wonders what he would call prac- tical . Perhaps an objection with a vote at the back of it would be practical . The Fifteenth Society . Last week we speculated as to how long there would be only fourteen national Suffrage societies . Not long . This week we give news of a fifteenth . This Suffrage « League of Youth " begins well , with such sporting characters as its well - known and popular young secre- taries , and we wish it every possible good wish ; may it help the cause , and incidentally have - and give - a good time . " Its constitution and its rules are as original as are its gallant young leaders . " Royal College of Surgeons . At an ordinary meeting of the Council the Secretary reported that the by - laws relating to the admission of women had been signed by the Home Secretary , the Lord Chancellor , and the Lord Chief Justice . A report was received from the president and vice - presidents on the form of the diplomas to be granted to women , and the privileges which the diploma would confer upon them . With regard to the collegiate privileges , the diploma will entitle them to admission to the museum , the library , and to all lectures . It will also render them eligible to compete for the collegiate and Jacksonian prizes . By - election . Owing to the death of Sir John Baker there is a vacancy at Portsmouth . It had been hoped that in view of the impending general election we might have been spared a by - election , but the latest news contradicts this . The Liberal candidate is Mr. R. C. Lambert ; the Labour , Mr. Alderman Sanders ; and the Conservative , Lord Charles Beresford . A Dream of Good Women .

The action taken with regard to the unhappy fatalities at Hemel Hempstead Workhouse Infirmary , which resulted in the acquittal of the nurse implicated , has been followed by a correspondence in the " Times , " started by Princess Christian and the officers of the Workhouse Nursing Association , and followed by the chairman of the Board of Guardians , the chairman of justices , and the foreman of the jury . The matter cannot now be allowed to rest in its present most unsatisfactory condition , and we hope that a full and free inquiry will be instituted by the Local Government Board . More Protestants . Mrs. Cobden Unwin last week resigned the member- ship of the Rochdale Women's Liberal Association on account of the treatment which Women Suffragists were receiving . She asks : " How long will the Liberal women of this country support a Government which refuses to make Women's Suffrage a Government measure , although the second reading of the Bill has been carried by a large majority of all parties in the House of Commons , and a Prime Minister who obstinately refuses to receive a depu- tation from any organised body of women ? " Mrs. Cobden Unwin is a daughter of Richard Cobden , and the wife of the well - known publisher , Mr. T. Fisher Unwin . Mrs. John Mills , president of the Altrincham and Bowdon Women's Liberal Association , said at a meeting last week that the recent declaration of Mr. Churchill had aroused women to a keener sense of their false posi- tion . While they would not accept the physical force policy , Liberal women would let the Government know that unless their enfranchisement were to be included in the next Reform Bill and were to form part of the Liberal election programme , they would strike and retire from all share in political contests . Evil Communications . It is sad indeed to hear of Mrs. Arthur Somervell being so far corrupted by her communications with those dread- ful women , the Suffragists , that she has taken to the methods of the more extreme section , and interrupted a Suffragist meeting in Edinburgh for quite a long time , on October 30 , with questions out of their proper order . We are glad indeed to hear that the managers of the meeting would allow no violence to be done her . Our Portrait .

No great subject can ever , surely , have been approached in such a timid , confused , hesitating , and pettifogging spirit as this one of women's enfranchisement . Last week we had the benefit of Lord Crewe's statement of the political situation , and it is noteworthy that in the whole of his long disquisition on the prospects of women's enfranchisement , this Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords did not utter one word that would have led anyone to suppose that he held or even professed liberal opinions : the whole of his speech was directed to showing women that to enfranchise them would be " bad business for the Liberals , and that by no process of gerrymandering could their votes be turned to party profit . He indulged in a good many prophesies , for some of which there would appear to be little or no justifica- tion . One remark , that where women had the Suffrage they took " singularly little interest in the politics of the State or colony to which they belonged , " is directly traversed by those who have experience in our colonies , and in parts of Australia it has even been noted that the women voted so well as to work up the interest of the men and make them vote better than they had ever done before . As to whether women would or would not vote for Free Trade , clericalism , taxing the foreigner , and so forth , we submit that neither Lord Crewe nor anyone else has any grounds for prophesying on the subject . The fact that Liberals are so sure women will be reactionary , and that Conservatives are so sure they will be revolu- tionary , only shows up very plainly one thing : they won't take the trouble to know and understand women ; they fear the unknown , and they cast about to find excuses for their inaction , which excuses they then dub with the more respectable name of reasons .


### Column 1

CAUSE . " 415 Lord Crewe proceeded to speak from what he called the low party point of view , " but as for us , we cannot see that he ever spoke on this subject from any other . It is this which fills women's hearts so full of bitterness and even contempt , -that their great human need should be met by men as if it were a mere pawn in some game the men were playing , -not for progress , but for power . Let us see what were the " truths " which Lord Crewe thought it good for women to hear . They seem to be two : first , that the support which we were given to understand we had in the House was unreal : it had been " rather reck- less , " it was hasty and " without consideration , " and it amounted to so little that a vote taken now would result in Women's Suffrage being defeated by a large majority ; secondly , that the Cabinet , although there was within it a majority in favour of reform ( this he did not deny ) , was not unanimous on the question , and although our friends would none of them risk office for our sakes , the opponents of the Suffrage would do so . In the Cabinet , that is to say , our friends are many and weak and our foes few and bitter . Lord Crewe is reported to have said that all this was cold comfort . It seems that he can hardly have realized the depth of indignation that such a diagnosis would arouse if women really believed it to be entirely true . We are to believe , according to him , that all those pledged Members in the House have gone back on their pledges , and that even those who voted for Mr. Stanger's and Mr. Howard's Bills would now vote against them ( for he did not make any particular qualifications the difficulty ) ; that their " support " was merely a blind , and that if they really feared a Bill might become law they would vote against it . Women , angered and impatient , have often made such statements in public , and have been rebuked for such cynicism , such " want of trust " in our noble statesmen ; are we to believe that it is true after all ? A Liberal says so ; are Liberal women to believe him ? He talked the usual nonsense about an " illiberal fran- chise . " One may bear with some patience the opposition of people who will move Heaven and Earth to get an enlarged franchise , but frankly , no Suffragist can take advice from a Liberal who is opposed to Women's Suffrage , who refuses to help it , who regards the demand for Adult Suffrage as " postponing the question , " and yet says that the women who prefer the bird in the hand are giving Liberals a " hard nut to crack . " What he does not seem to grasp is that women want the sex disability removed , and that speedily ; they do not intend to work patiently for a Liberal party which offers them Adult " dim and speculative future . " The Liberal Suffrage in a who prefers to enfranchise no women because he cannot see his way to enfranchising all , gives women a still harder nut to crack , " and when , like Lord Crewe , he says one thing to women and another to men , women may be excused if they think his advice not worth following . Lord Crewe spoke in the House of Lords on the London Elections Bill , and there he said : " When it was proposed to remove a particular anomaly , they were constantly met with the argument that it was no use dealing with the matter in a piecemeal fashion , and that if anomalies were to be removed , they must all be swept away at once . But the whole custom of legislation in this country had been piecemeal legislation . All the Reform Bills mentioned were undoubtedly piecemeal by Viscount Midleton measures , and full of exceptions , hedged about with safe- guards , and conferring the Suffrage on one particular If they had a chance of meet- ing a particular grievance , the existence of which was not What was this denied , they ought to take it . " " grievance " ? Why , that some 40,000 men in London were temporarily deprived of their votes when they removed , and that a few other men had more than one vote . Can this compare , as a grievance , with the fact that between eight and nine million women in England are entirely deprived of votes for the whole of the term of their natural lives ? Men made the " property vote . " It is only when women ask to share it that they find that they cannot give it to women . C class at a time . Lord Crewe , like so many politicians , took care to leave Mr. Asquith had his party many doors of escape .

416 THE COMMON promised a Reform Bill before the dissolution of Parlia- ment , barring accidents . The existence of the House of Lords appears to be an accident ( one which might have been foreseen , we submit , but on ne saurait penser a tout , , " and doubtless Mr. Asquith just forgot the House of Lords when he made his kind promise ) ; this will prob- ably prevent the Reform Bill from materializing , and then , in a new Parliament , of course , a Reform Bill can- not be brought in till near its end ; it will then be some- one's duty to invent another happy " accident , " and so on as long as the game pays . " Meanwhile Lord Crewe gives Liberal women two alter- natives : ( 1 ) " If the Suffrage was not made an issue by the Liberal party , and if they yet considered that in spite of that the party remained the best engine for progress in the country , they would be prepared to hope for the con- version of the Liberal party to their views . ( 2 ) If they thought that the cause of the Suffrage was more precious than the others , then he should even advise them to work only for the conversion of women to Woman Suffrage . ' It seems as if Lord Crewe could only imagine women as so many Lord Crewes in petticoats . Alternatives will suggest themselves to women other than being " pre- pared " to " hope " for " conversion , " or than devoting themselves to converting those who are as helpless as themselves . We have no fear that women will know how to use rather more powerful weapons , and that they will by - and - bye make it as well worth while for a politician to be their friend as to be their enemy . The Week's Wage . By Mrs. Murray Hickson . A thousand words are a thousand words ; one cannot say much in them . But " The Common Cause " is a busy paper whose crowded spaces afford no wider room ; there- fore , when the Editor kindly allowed me a thousand words in which to write about " A Little Cheque , " I was duly grateful , and now , when I am permitted to touch upon another aspect of the same subject , I am more grateful still . It is hard upon a woman of the upper classes whose hus- band keeps too tight a hand upon the purse - strings , yet her lot is easy and pleasant compared with that of her poorer sister in the same plight . If the one feels the pinch of curtailed " pin - money , " the degradation of having to " coax " for the price of a pair of gloves , what must it be to the other , whose bread , whose very existence , depends upon the character or the mood of the man she has married ? In our class many women possess a portion of their own -- settled upon them and secured by law . If we choose to let our husbands have the spending of that portion the fault is ours ; due to inherent weakness on our part , inherent selfishness on his ; it becomes , in fact , a question of character , and for questions of char- acter no law finds a remedy . Laws help those who help themselves ; they are powerless to provide for people who will not put them into operation . Of course , many upper- class wives are portionless ; for them some provision should be arranged to ensure a certain justice , a certain independence , but their need for protection is nothing when compared with that of the working woman . Can it be generally known that a man is in no way forced by law to provide for his wife and children ? He may keep them without proper money , without proper food ; he may desert them , he may cut down the supplies below living point , yet there is no redress . Only this : if wife and children are forced into the Workhouse , the Workhouse authorities may recover the amount of their keep from the husband - if they can find him . The wife has no power to compel her " man to provide for her or for her children . " 3 This being so , any law apportioning to the wife a fixed allowance , according to her husband's means , would be of service in cases of gross neglect or of desertion . That no such law exists is an amazing though , luckily , not a well recognised fact . Did the mass of working - men realize their irresponsibility , possibly their families would be worse off than now ; as it is , there exist among them- just as amongst men of better class - varying standards

CAUSE " " NOVEMBER 18 , 1909 . of honour as regards their womankind ; some high , some low , some unaccountable ; yet few of them falling below a notion that bare , necessary maintenance should be pro- vided . The opinion of their fellows carries weight , as it does with most of us ; but the ideas of many working - men about the necessities of life for women and children are not only interesting , but astonishing . In one of the big Yorkshire cities it is quite a common thing for a man earning from two to five pounds a week to give his wife sixteen , eighteen , or twenty shillings upon which to pro- vide for the household , while he spends the remainder on dogs , sport , ' gambling , and drink . Now it is not easy to clothe and feed six or seven people , to pay the doctor , and to keep a household going upon sixteen , or even upon twenty shillings a week . The wife works very , very hard to do it . She bears the children , she brings them up , she cooks , cleans , sews , and nurses . She feeds her family , her- self , and her lord and master ( these North - country skilled workmen like to eat and drink abundantly ) , and she defrays all household expenses out of this pittance . Presently bad times come ; nothing is saved ; the woman is obliged to run into debt . Again trade revives ; money is plentiful , but frequently the wife does not benefit . She has fallen behind in her weekly payments and she cannot regain lost ground . Then follows the inevitable . The harassed shopkeeper , often a poor widow barely able to keep head above water , resorts to the County Court , and the man - responsible and ostensible head of the family , as he likes to be , as he should be considered - is summoned for debt . He seldom , or never , appears ; he sends his drudge the wife . Arrived in court , she can only plead : Please , your Honour , I have but sixteen shillings a week : That's what my man gives me . " The wages books are turned up ; the court finds that the husband is making two , three , or five pounds , and the court says so . The statement doesn't affect the woman , poor thing . She is usually unable to realize that , under these conditions , she ought to receive more , and all she can say is : " My man must have some money for boots and beer . " This reply greatly amuses a busy judge in the North ; he once remarked that in all his life he had not spent on boots what a Yorkshire workman seems to lay out in a single year . In the end a judgment order is made ; but how can the wife pay ? She can't , she doesn't , and the matter drags on until finally her husband is ordered to pay or go to prison - not " for debt , " as so many believe ; imprison- ment for debt is obsolete and unknown , but for contempt of court , for refusing to pay just debts while possessing the means with which to discharge them . He seldom goes to prison . In 99 cases out of a hundred he damns and pays ! Then the whole weary round recommences , and so on , da capo . Now , if some law could be framed it would be difficult , yet surely not impossible , if some law could be framed to secure a minimum allowance to every wife based upon her husband's earnings , half this misery would be swept away . Surely , with Woman's Suffrage , some- thing could be done . Without it , there seems but little chance , because men , in the bulk , are unable to realize how hardly a shortage of money presses upon their women . They do not mean to be cruel , either the work- ing - men or the men of the upper classes , but it is not they who lack independence ; and they simply haven't imagination to put themselves in a women's place . How should they ? The A friend urges that such a law would press hardly upon those men whose wives are bad managers , foolish , drunken , or spendthrift . Also that no good man with- holds a proper maintenance from his wife and children . This is true . But laws are not framed to shackle good people , but to keep in order bad or faulty ones , and for the protection of the weak who cannot protect themselves , whether " the weak " compose a class or a sex . drunken , the silly , wife would have but a minimum of money to squander . No husband would be bound to give more than a fixed sum , though , of course , he could give more when he wished to do so , even to the half , or the whole , of his kingdom . And - again it would be difficult , yet possible - some clause could surely be arranged which should protect a husband from his wife's culpable extravagance and , in view of her incapacity , allow him to administer her portion ?

NOVEMBER 18 , 1909 . THE COMMON In any case such a law would press no more heavily upon a careful , generous husband mated with a bad wife , than its absence now affects the good wife , eager to do her best , but groaning under the oppression of a tyrannical or mean husband - an from whose injustice she " owner can obtain no redress .

The whole force and enthusiasm of the National Union must from now be put forth to carry out the great scheme of constructive work at the general election . To start this great campaign , we are holding a meeting in the Scala Theatre on Tuesday , December 7 , at 8 o'clock . Mrs. Fawcett , Councillor Margaret Ashton , and Miss Helen Fraser , all speakers from the fighting line , will there set forth our policy and , with the help of Miss Bertha Mason in the chair , put before the members of the Union our practical needs in the way of funds . What we have to do in this coming general election is to make sure the Budget question shall not swamp the equally urgent matter of women's enfranchisement . That is not an easy task . But it can be done . We have the beginnings of such a work in the voters ' petition . We must make this an overwhelming demand , and send up to Parliament a mandate which cannot be disregarded . The petition is to be one part of our policy . As to the rest , we must wait till the 6th for the Council's decisions , which will be announced at the Scala on the 7th . As for the petition , we must set ourselves to get at least one million signatures , and this work can be started at once . The petition forms are ready at the office , and the register of voters can be obtained at any Town Hall . All that need be done is to get the forms , look out the names of the voters on the register , and then go and see them ; at the same time holding small meetings , whether indoors or outdoors , explaining how much men can do to help us by signing our petition , and by asking their candidate questions . In a few days a simple leaflet about the petition will be ready , and if every secretary will send for election literature early it will be a great help . We can make this election a Suffrage election if we put our whole strength forward . We must make it a triumph of constitutionalism and of justice , and show at this moment of political excitement that the women of the nation must no longer be excluded from sharing in the responsibility of a great national decision . Just now what we need most is help for the meeting ; people to sell tickets and to buy them , and distribute handbills , to act as stewards , and to give donations . Will everyone who can help send in his or her name as soon as possible to me , at 25 , Victoria Street ? MARION PHILLIPS .

The general election will be fought on one great issue -the greatest constitutional fight of generations . Where do Women Suffragists stand , and what is expedient for the to do ? Since the last general election much has been done for the reform . Conflicting policies have been carried out , and tactics of obstruction and reprisal have loomed large . The anti - Government policy , conceived at its inception to be one that would wrest a pledge speedily from the Government , has gone on till it has degenerated into an anti - Liberal one , till antagonism , riot , and violence have become the order of the day , and its most brilliant exponents have become merely the tools of the vote - catching politician of the Opposition . It was an idea that was the result of a grave miscalculation of the support the demand had in the country . It was a policy that was a failure eighteen months ago , that was admittedly a failure when they cast the first stone , and refused the right of free speech to the Cabinet . If the anti - Government policy were really effective politi- cally , if it exerted the pressure upon the governing party of which we hear so much , no tactics save the anti - Govern- ment by - election policy would be necessary . If it really put pressure upon the Government , if it really damaged and defeated its candidates , no women would need to go to prison , no tactics would be required . It does not .

We desire to be of it , and the policy that one might adopt if one desired to antagonise and go out is not the policy to adopt if one desires to share . All over the country the electors have been antagonised by the policy - in the House of Commons some people go so far as to say that if the Government were to bring in the Bill at this moment , the private members would defeat it . The anti - Government policy , examined in the light of practical politics , is built upon a house of cards . It is entirely built upon the 420 pledges given at the last general election . Only about 70 of these pledges were confirmed by the electorate . We do not grant our reforms in this country - we do not make great consti- We shall never tutional changes on that kind of pledge . get this reform now till it is definitely taken up by one of the great parties . We shall never have it taken up by one of the great parties till the other policy , ours , which has saved this movement from being cast aside altogether politically , takes its rightful place as the policy of the Suffrage movement . Realise that this is a great task - that we are not going to rush this or any British Government or the British people on this question . We must go on constructing - go on doing the greatest work , the work of education - go on with our practical political work , the task of securing mandates from the electors and people , the task of building up an educated public opinion among the people , the electors , and , of Then the pressure upon our necessity , the parties . Cabinet will come . Then we shall demand with our forces arrayed and not in vain . At the general election we have a great work to do . Do not let the one great issue depress you . Humanity's mind has room for more than one thought . Electors will realise the great truth and just claim that , upon the great constitutional question , qualified women should have spoken and had the right to cast their weight as full citizens as well as men . The electors must give us a mandate from every con- stituency . Every member of the Union must work to secure that . The note that we must strike in our campaigning is the note of support - not of antagonism . The country is tired of antagonism - tired to death of reprisals and per- sonal and party attacks . We must strike a saner note - a strong hopeful note , and we must go into this great fight , we must give our money , our enthusiasm , and our personal service with the courage that those who do battle for the righteous and inevitably victorious cause always have . A fight against great odds is a glorious thing . See to it that the National Union's fight is gloriously fought . HELEN FRASER . The London Society . Bermondsey Election .

A friend has lent her flat in Victoria Street , and an office has been opened there . The " Younger Suffragists " also have a typewriter and some furniture , but they need a great many other things , which they hope their friends will give them . The first meeting of the society will be held on December 9 ( afternoon ) . Miss F. Robertson , one of our members , has lent her house , and Lady Betty Balfour has very kindly consented to speak . The hon . secretary , Miss O. J. Dunlop , will be delighted to give further information to anyone who wishes to join . The office address is : 36 , Victoria Street , Westminster . The National Union in Salisbury . I have just spent ten days in that beautiful old Cathedral town , Salisbury , organising the formation of the Salisbury and District W.S.S. On every hand I met with the utmost kindness and courtesy , not to mention practical help , especially from the owner of a motor - car , who took me round to an outlying district . I had an easy task in setting this new society on its feet , for much work had been done before I came , and arrangements for meetings were settled previous to my arrival by the energetic and businesslike hon . secre- tary , Miss Hardy . A I addressed six meetings in all one at the inauguration meeting of the new branch , another at the Adult School , by request of the Mayoress , a third speech to the staff of the Godolphin School , followed by an address by special request at the reception held in honour of the new Mayoress , Mrs. Shepherd ( who I am glad to say is a member of the com- mittee ) , besides another to the Wesleyan mothers ' meeting . I held forth the same evening at a public meeting , the success of which more than realised our fondest hopes . large audience filled the Central Hall , and gave the closest attention to all I had to say to them . Mrs. Murray - Prior , from Australia , and Miss Bagnall , from New Zealand , greatly pleased everyone with their interesting details about the effect of the woman's vote in both these Commonwealths . An irate Anti - Suffragist desired to floor me , but unfortu- nately for herself she tried to heckle me on the particular points I have specialised in , and my stream of information in reply hugely delighted the audience , and clearly showed in which direction their sympathy lay . A good collection was taken for the funds of the new branch , and a brisk sale of literature and " Common Causes was carried on by several energetic sellers . A satisfactory proportion of the audience was composed of electors , and the policy of the N.U. was explained at the outset by a most popular chair- man , the Rev. Geoffrey Hill . Plans for future work have been well laid , and ought to have good results . DOROTHY EDWARDS ( Organiser ) . Deputation to Lord Crewe . The following report is taken from " The Times " of November 12 : - A deputation of 14 members of the Forward Suffrage Union within the Women's Liberal Federation was received by Lord Crewe at the Colonial Office yesterday . Lady Grove , who introduced the deputation , said their object was to try to obtain some definite idea of the attitude the present Government meant to adopt on the question of Woman Suffrage when they appealed to the country , in order that the dissatisfaction which was spreading rapidly among a large proportion of Liberal women throughout the country might be arrested . The Prime Minister's pronouncement , though appreciated , did not them . The Hon . Mrs. Bertrand Russell referred to the severe loss which the Liberal party was suffering in the constituencies through the fact that the ardent women Liberals were obliged to concentrate on the suffrage . Lord Crewe , in reply , acknowledged the moderation with which the ladies had stated their wishes . He feared he could not make anything like a declaration of policy on behalf of the Government . He had not before been asked to make any declaration on Female Suffrage , but he had never been a violent opponent . He had felt the weight of what he might call the sex considerations pure and simple , but he had never regarded an extension of the franchise to women as con- stituting a public danger . His own belief was that , so far as general politics were concerned , the concession would not have any great effect . Looking at it from the point of view of a Liberal , he thought that many social good causes , such as temperance , would be definitely strengthened . On the other side , causes which he did not himself favour , such as clericalism and denominational education , would also gain some considerable access of strength . As regarded the fiscal question , he thought that the cause of free food would probably be strengthened by the women's vote . On the other hand , he would not be surprised if the desire to tax the foreigner - if they believed such an operation could be carried into effect would be largely helped by the vote of the female sex . He considered that the main objection to the extension

NOVEMBER 18 , 1909 . THE COMMON of the Suffrage was that it would add to the number of indifferent voters . Other countries in which Woman Suffrage had been given had experienced that difficulty . It had been found that they took singularly little interest in the politics of the State or colony to which they belonged . They could not deny that the question , quite apart from the events of the moment , did divided the Liberal party sharply . If they made this question a definite issue at the general election , it would undoubtedly involve changes in those who now held office in the party . That , women said , was a matter of no importance , but it would involve a distinct loss of strength to the Liberal party . Speaking from the low point of view , the losses were merely a matter of counting heads . The losses at one end might be as great as the gain at the other . He confessed to a sympathy with the point of view expressed by the deputation . It was hard , when they had given their time and money and energies to the Liberal cause , to find that the one item in the whole pro- gramme of politics to which they attached the most importance was set aside by the Liberal party . It seemed to him that each must judge for herself in such a case as that . If the Suffrage was not made an issue by the Liberal party , and if they yet considered that , in spite of that , the party remained the best engine for progress in the country , they would be prepared to hope for the conversion of the party to their views . If they thought that the cause of the Suffrage was more precious than the others , then he would even advise them to work only for the conversion of women to Woman Suffrage . All this was very cold comfort . ( Hear , hear . ) He believed there was a way out of the difficulty , but he was not going to say what that was . He was not going to forecast the future . They had asked a simple question , and if they asked whether there was a chance of Woman Suffrage being made a plank in the Government programme if they went to the country , he replied that there was not . He understood many women , although excellent Liberals in all respects , would sooner take an illiberal franchise than none at all . That was a very hard nut for Liberals to crack . If they were to join in giving a narrow form of franchise , which in effect would have the result of attaching the vote in a great majority of cases to property rather than to the individual , they would be breaking one of the Liberal principles and would also be doing something of an extreme quixotic character from the party point of view , because they would be damaging their position very seriously . On the other hand , he admitted , if they wanted anything like Adult Suffrage , they did seem to be postponing the question , because that was so large a business that the country might fairly be expected to take time to consider it . But a general reform was of an urgent character , and he should think that they would not long postpone the question , and then the Suffrage cause would undoubtedly come under consideration . He had said more than he intended to say , and was afraid he had given them little comfort . That was not from want of good will , but it was useless to disguise the facts . Lady Grove mentioned , with regard to Lord Crewe's state- ment that a limited Bill was not democratic , that of the million and a half women who would be enfranchised under that Bill , 82 per cent . would be working women . Manchester Liberals . On Wednesday , November 10 , a special meeting of the General Council of the Manchester Liberal Federation was held in the Reform Club , Manchester , to discuss the following resolution : - " That this meeting of the Council of the Man- chester Liberal Federation , while regretting and condemning the policy of violence adopted by a section of the Suffragists , recognises the urgency of women's need for the Parliamentary vote , and desires to give all the assistance in its power to the promotion of a practical measure for their speedy enfran- chisement . " Mr. C. P. Scott ( president ) was in the chair , and he was supported by Mr. W. E. Thompson ( chairman of the General Committee ) and Mr. William Royle ( chairman of the Executive ) . The Chairman explained that the resolution was not presented as official , but was there " to focus discussion , ' and the Council was at liberty to pass , to reject , or to amend it . Three women then addressed the meeting . 33 Mrs. W. Tattersall ( president , Liberal Women's Suffrage League ) argued that the women's vote would tend to reduce the rough and tumble of political life , and that the only way of educating the masses politically was to give them the vote . Women wanted the vote because it would raise their status , and also because of the many reforms which they had at heart . Councillor Margaret Ashton ( chairman of the Executive of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage ) said that women , just like men , were citizens of this country . Representative government made for the greatest happiness of a nation , and no government could be really representative if any large section of the community was deprived of repre- sentative power . Women were interested in good govern- ment equally with men , and suffered under bad laws like men , and they understood what were the laws which oppressed them better than men . Votes for women was not a revolu- tionary demand , but only a progressive necessity of an

CAUSE , 419 advancing country , Women had seen class after class enfranchised and interest after interest represented in Parlia- ment , and they alone were left out . They asked for the vote not entirely that they might protect themselves , but also that they might be heard on all legislation . They did not ask that women should be able to sit in Parliament , but what they did want was that women should be allowed to elect members of Parliament , who would then be interested in directly representing women . They might talk about the influence of women , but men had influence and a vote as well , and influence with the vote was infinitely more powerful than influence without it . It was not good for the nation that What one section of it should be entirely unrepresented . harm had ever come of extending the franchise to fresh classes ? What weakness to the nation had resulted from giving interest in national concerns to greater numbers of the people ? There was a whole side of social reform in which women could do more to help forward progress , because it touched the inner family life , and it was the family life of the nation that was at stake at the present time . Women asked for the vote for the sake of the nation , and not for themselves alone . no Mrs. F. T. Swanwick ( hon . secretary of the North of England Society ) said she was glad to speak to party men , because they did not often give her the chance . Few party men came to Suffrage meetings , and it was not easy to get them to hear what the women had to say . Consequently they made an absurd bogey of the thing called " Suffragist , " which was quite unlike the creature they were familiar with in daily life unfeminine , unsexed , injurious , and on account to be listened to . They were party men . What did their party , the great Liberal party , stand for ? Were they banded together merely to protect vested interests , to uphold privilege , to maintain monopoly ? She had been reared in the tradition that the Liberal party stood for the liberties of the people . Were the people only men ? We were hearing a great deal now of the House of Lords resisting the will of the people . Men But to women , both Houses were Houses of Lords . exploited the women not only in deed but in word , until the " poor widow " was a byword for laughter in the Men's House . Among their Free Trade posters they had a picture of a woman trying to shut the cupboard door against a great Tariff Reform hand about to seize her food ; if they were honest , why did they not give women the key with which to lock the cupboard door ? There was no sex war yet . Women had men , many and good , on their side ; these men were the idealists , the intellectuals , the working - men . In Manchester they had a good number among party men - Sir Charles Schwann , Sir George Kemp , Mr. Zimmermann , Mr. Scott , and others . But Elections were never they wanted the whole party to move . upon one issue only . They recognised that the House of Lords was bound to be a great question , but there was no reason why they should not include Women's Suffrage as one of the great questions upon which opinion would be taken at the general election . They were proposing to deal with divorce , poor law , industry , education , drink , and religion . Before they touched any of these questions women must have freedom to make their opinion felt . Women were not free . She would ask only two questions : Would any man think he was free if he were not considered to be the parent of his own child , and if at any time women alone could deprive him by law of the means of earning an honest livelihood ? She quoted Mr. Asquith's speech at the Eighty Club last July , and said she only asked them to apply these principles . When they swelled their chests at party meetings and sang " Land of Hope and Glory , Mother of the Free , " let them remember that in England only the men were free . Mr. Royle moved the resolution , which was seconded from the body of the hall . A rider , proposed by Mr. G. G. Arm- strong , ran : " And respectfully urges His Majesty's Govern- ment to include this measure in the programme on which they Mr. Armstrong go to the country at the general election . " thought that if they passed the resolution it would leave them where they were . They wanted the next election to give a mandate for Women's Suffrage , and how could that be if it was not in the party's programme ? The Prime Minister had promised to include Women's Suffrage in a Government Bill if a majority of the House of Commons supported it , and now they must ask the Government to go a step further , and make it a Cabinet question . Was it fair to put such a strain on the loyalty of Liberal Women Suffragists as they did when they gave them only nebulous promises ? Mrs. Barton ( a member of the Council ) supported the rider , which was rather hurriedly put to the vote and lost . Mr. J. A. Bland moved an amendment recommending the claims of women to the Parliamentary vote , but postponing any action until the policy of violence should be abandoned . Mr. Alexander Porter and others opposed this , and it was lost . After further rather desultory discussion , the Chairman , before putting the resolution , said : " So far from the women coming here and begging us as Liberals to support this cause , we ought to be all tumbling over each other to help them in every possible way . It is not that they are asking us to do something new and strange , they are simply asking us to give the most obvious application to principles which we have been proclaiming from on high ever since we were Liberals and had a voice to proclaim them . " The resolution was then put and carried , with fourteen dissentients . The result was greeted with cheers .

420 was THE COMMON It is important to make quite clear that the passing of this resolution , in an open Council meeting of which due notice had been given , commits the Manchester Liberal Federation to the terms of the resolution .

The deputation was introduced by Arthur Richardson , Esq . , M.P. , and the hon . secretary , Mrs. W. E. Dowson , said that if the Government did not make it clear that they would help women , they could not have the help of the best and most progressive women of the country . Dr. Macnamara said the functions of men and women as citizens were different but of equal importance . The absence of the franchise certainly did place women in an inferior position to men . He held the view that it was economically sound that where a woman did the same work as a man she should get the same wages , but he believed that if a woman had a husband who could maintain her , her best place was in her home . The tactics of the militant section of the Suffragists had set back the cause of Women's Suffrage , but his own views would survive any danger from the action of these women . He had always given his support to Women's Suffrage , and was entirely in favour of that and of Adult Suffrage . " Nottingham Daily Express .

At Dalston protest meetings were held outside Mr. Samuel's meeting ; at the Savoy Theatre , during a performance of " The Mountaineers , " several members of the W.S.P.U. questioned Mr. Lloyd- George , who was witnessing the performance from a box ; and at Bristol various demonstrations were made in connec- tion with the visit of Mr. Winston Churchill and Mr. Birrell : windows were broken at the Liberal Club and Post Office , and Miss Garnett assaulted Mr. Churchill at the station with a whip . As a consequence , Miss Wentworth and Miss Allen were sent to prison for 14 days ; Miss Ellen Pitman was com- mitted to the Assizes ; and Miss Teresa Garnett was sentenced to one month with hard labour .

CAUSE . NOVEMBER 18 , 1909 . to speak to us at our " At Home " on Wednesday , 17th ; and on the 24th Mrs. Amy Sanderson from Yorkshire ( a delight- ful speaker , who is too seldom heard in London ) and Mrs. H. W. Nevinson are our speakers . Those who saw the wonderful women's pageant at the Scala Theatre will , I think , go to our Yuletide festival at the Albert Hall on 11th December , to see it again , and to enjoy all the other attrac- tions . If they can arrange to be at the Albert Hall on that day from 3 till 10.30 , the time will not hang heavy on their hands . The Rev. R. J. Campbell gives us each year an address , which appears later as a pamphlet , and which is thus an important addition to the literature of the movement . This year the meeting which he will address for us is to be at the Town Hall , Bradford , on the 7th December , and as Mrs. Despard will also speak , the hall should be crowded . On next Monday ( 22nd ) the Hampstead branch has arranged a meeting at Wellington Hall at 8 p.m. , at which the speakers will be Mrs. Despard , Mrs. Arncliffe Sennett , and Mrs. H. W. Nevinson . The Compleat Organizer . X. - BY - ELECTIONS ( 4 ) . PETITIONS . The election petition is at the present time a most im- portant feature of the by - election propaganda . Being signed by electors only , it is more valuable than any other class of petition , as every signature is verified by the Peti- tions Committee of the House of Commons , and the aim of the organizer should be to send up a petition on which the total of electors ' signatures is equal to if not larger than the number of votes polled by the successful candidate . This would indeed be a mandate from the country . From the commencement of the campaign the petition arrangements must be organized . Immediately the com- mittee rooms are taken , printed posters , avoiding any party colours , should be placarded around the rooms in as many places as possible , and small paragraphs inserted in the local Press , above all emphasising its non - party attitude . Petition forms should be lying in the committee rooms , and others taken to each meeting during the campaign , and the necessity of signing there and then urged on the electors ; many signatures obtained beforehand relieves the work on the day of polling . The prayer on the first page of a Parliamentary petition must be handwritten , though all successive headings may be printed . It is advisable to ask someone possessing good legible handwriting to set out the first form , which can then be signed up in the committee rooms and put in a place of safety till the total signatures are obtained . Care must be taken to ensure a sufficient number of forms being provided ; as an average there will probably be fifteen signa- tures on each sheet , so , taking the official figures of the electorates at the respective polling booths , it can easily be estimated how many to provide , with a margin in case of accidents . A paper should be pinned up in the committee rooms , and the names set down of every available person willing to help on polling day , the list of polling stations and their respective numbers of electors obtained , and , if certain helpers can only go to certain polling stations , or are able only to give help during certain hours , the official num- ber of the polling booths and the hours should be written against the respective names on the list . To avoid mistakes it is well to have cards typed advising petition workers ( 1 ) that no invalid signature must be crossed out or a line run through it ; it must be left to be thrown out when the signatures are verified by the Petitions Committee ; also ( 2 ) that the petition must be signed by those only who have votes for the Parliamentary division in which the election is taking place ; and ( 3 ) that , in the event of an elector being unable to write , his name may be put in by another person , he making a cross between his christian and surname , or in case of more than one christian name , between the second or last and the surname . In a country con- stituency stamped post - cards pre - addressed to the organizer , with blank spaces for name of polling station , name of worker , and number of signatures obtained , should be sent to every person in charge , with a request to state these par- ticulars and post when the poll is closed , in order that the organizer may know the total numbers and have some idea of the success of the petition . This is not necessary in a borough where the stations are more concentrated and the majority of the workers turn up at the committee rooms at the close of the day . Having obtained the names and addresses of all those who are willing to assist , and the help of every available person having been pressed into the service , a schedule of the poll- ing stations must be drawn up with the workers arranged according to accessibility to the different booths and the hours they are able to devote to the work . It is obvious that the heaviest places in point of numbers must be accorded to the experienced helpers , and more particularly that local workers whose opinions are well known should be appointed to those districts where their presence is an assur- ance to some of the more suspicious electors that the petition is entirely non - party - in other words , a woman of known Liberal views is priceless in a polling station in a district

NOVEMBER 18 , 1909 . THE COMMON which runs Liberal , as her participation in the work is absolute proof to those who have not attended the meetings that the petition is not directed against the Government . Having planned the time - table , giving if possible short intervals for rest and meals ( if the organizer is lucky in having sufficient help to go round and can provide alter- nates ) instructions are sent to each helper nominating the place and hours on duty , and travelling arrangements in the case of those who come from a distance . In a county constituency the final arrangements differ somewhat from those of a borough , and when there is no local Suffrage Society the organizer is nearly always short- handed , with probably thirty or forty polling stations to be staffed . Setting aside , therefore , as hopeless the desirability of giving time off for rest and meals , there may even then not be enough help to work each polling station ; in that case the larger electorates obviously have the first claim , and the luckless helpers know their hours of duty are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. [ To be continued . ] Suffrage Matinee at the Scala Theatre . The Times " has the following account : - The members of the Actresses ' Franchise League and the Women Writers ' Suffrage League combined to give a matinée which lasted for over four hours - four hours of real and sustained interest . Of course it was a matinée with a purpose . What women have done , and are doing , and mean to do was the theme throughout , but though the part which mere man played on the stage during the afternoon was hardly such as to fill his fellow - men with pride , it was all fair fun and fair fighting . Three new one - act plays were presented - The Pot and the Kettle , by Miss Cicely Hamilton and Miss Christopher St. John ; Master , by Miss Gertrude Mouillot ; and The Out- cast , by Miss Beatrice Harraden and Miss Bessie Hatton . In the first of these the Pot is a youthful Anti - Suffragist indicted for assaulting and battering a titled Suffragist In the second is the Master a lazy good - for- nothing , who for years has been waiting for some- thing to turn up , living meanwhile on the earnings of his hard - working wife . Both of these are written with the express purpose of ridiculing the opponents of Woman Suffrage , but , quite apart from that , they are really excellent little plays , abounding in good - humoured and amusing satire . They were acted with the sort of cleverness which was to be found at the Court during the Vedrenne - Barker régime , and should find their way into the regular bill at one of the theatres . The Outcast is less sparkling , and depends on sentiment rather than satire for its interest . But it , too , is decidedly above the average . The programme also included songs by Miss Esther Palliser , stories by Miss Helen Mar , a pas de fascina- tion by Miss Geraldine Somerset and M. Stefan Hallé , and Miss Fanny Wentworth and Miss Beatrice Lindley sang and told stories at the piano . " But the unique interest of the performance lay not in any of these , but in those separate parts of it which gave the idealistic view of the cause of Woman Suffrage . Apparently the whole of the large audience were in enthusiastic sympathy with the movement . But even its opponents must have been struck by the intense earnestness and the absolute good taste with which those ideals were presented . The keynote of the prologue written for the occasion by Mr. Laurence Housman and spoken by Miss Margaret Halstan was struck in the line , " No cause is great that is not hard to gain . " The prologue was followed by a tableau from a cartoon by Mr. W. H. Margetson , in which Lady Grove was " Justice , " Mr. War- burton Gamble " Prejudice , " and Miss Maud Hoffman " The Woman . " In the Pageant of Famous Women which ended the performance this tableau was again the centre of the scene . The Woman , played this time by Miss Adeline Bourne , was appealing to Justice against the tyranny of Prejudice ( Mr. Kenyon Musgrave ) . After Prejudice had made his general charge of Woman's incompetency , the Woman called as her witnesses the Learned Women , the Artists , the Saintly Women , the Heroic Women , the Rulers , and the Warrior- Women famous in the history of the world , amongst them Miss Edith Craig , who arranged the pageant , as Rosa Bon- heur , Mrs. Brown Potter as Charlotte Corday , Miss Pauline Chase as Joan of Arc , Miss Cicely Hamilton as Christian Davis , Miss Elaine Inescourt as Hypatia , Miss Granville as Isabella , Miss Marion Terry as Florence Nightingale , and Miss Ellen Terry as Nance Oldfield . " If , " said Miss Ellen Terry , " Prejudice had had its way in matters theatrical- " This stage had been as dull as now ' tis merry , No Oldfield , Woffington , or - Ellen Terry . " With this picturesque appeal to history the women writers and actors brought their appeal for the cause which they have at heart to a close , and no one seemed to be tired by the length of the performance . Even for those who do not believe in the wisdom of the cause it was an afternoon to be remembered .

CAUSE . 421 The Girls , The Boys , and The Cakes . A FABLE . Some fortunate boys had been given , or won , A number of cakes , while their sisters had none ; Yet when they demanded a moderate share Their brothers did nothing but giggle and stare . They reasoned politely , they argued with heat , They screamed and they shouted for something to eat ; But whether they shrieked or were perfectly dumb The boys never gave them so much as a crumb . " The girls who are silent , " they said , " do not take The slightest intelligent interest in cake ; While as for the others who scream and who bawl , They are rude , and shall therefore have nothing at all . " Then some girls grew angry , and scarcely polite , And proved most imprudently eager to fight , For their brothers would win , as a matter of course , If they settled their quarrel by physical force . " How horrid and shocking ! " some other girls thought , As they watched how their relatives struggled and fought . " Their tactics are wrong ! How they wrangle and brawl ! " And therefore their critics did nothing at all , Till somebody said , " It would be a mistake To think more of tactics than getting our cake ; Let us each one do something , the thing she thinks best , Instead of lamenting the faults of the rest , And then one fine morning , perhaps , we shall wake And find that we each are possessed of a cake ! " -G . M. GEORGE . Minding the Baby . Babies and men were the distinguishing features of the audience at the North of England Society's Pendleton meet- ing last week . The men were mostly Socialists , who had come to hear Mr. Edward Carpenter , and all who stayed till the end voted for our resolution calling upon the candidates for West Salford to include Women's Suffrage in their election addresses . The babies , indeed , were the only protestants , and they protested to such purpose that the stewards hit upon the device of establishing a crêche in an adjoining room , to which the infants were removed , leaving their mothers to listen to the speeches in peace . It is alarming to be confronted with several unknown babies , and to feel that somehow they have to be kept quiet for an hour and a half ; but for Mrs. Maconachie and Miss Gilson and Miss Courtney babies have no terrors , and the children had the time of their lives . Mrs. Maconachie left the platform to take a fretful baby from its mother's arms , and was told that " she would scream her eyes out , " but " she " was perfectly happy for the rest of the evening . We are taking Teddy bears to our next meeting . Anti - Suffra- gists , please note : that the unwomanly Suffragists can mind babies and conduct a public meeting at the same time . Foreign News . BELGIUM . We read in La Francaise that the National Congress " des Œuvres Catholiques " held recently at Malines resolved that it is desirable that : 1. Catholic women should use their influence to obtain the legislative reforms necessary to the interests of women , notably more equitable marriage settle- ments . 2. They should respect and cause others to respect the principle of equity : for equal work , equal pay . 3. They should endeavour to convert public opinion to the Catholic ideal of one moral standard for both sexes . POLAND . A delegation from feminist societies led by Mlle . Duleba presented itself recently to the Polish Diet at Leopold to ask the leaders of the different political parties what would be their attitude towards the Stattubsbi Bill demanding univer . sal Suffrage for both sexes . The Conservatives would accord the franchise without eligibility ; the Liberals and National- ists would enfranchise only privileged women who pay taxes and have passed through secondary schools ; the Socialists stand for sex equality before the law . The feminists are carrying on an active propagandist cam- paign , and at a meeting on October 15 of 2,000 persons , a resolution calling for the inclusion of women in the next Reform Bill was passed unanimously . A " Polish Union for Women's Suffrage " has been formed at Cracow . Reviews . The Magazines .

422 THE COMMON wholly dependent on a man who cannot or will not support her and her children adequately . In " Echoes , " some good illustrations are given of what women mean when they say that men regard as venial offences which strike at the very life of the nation . One of the most interesting and certainly the most curious and exotic of all the numbers , however , is a breath of the Spirit of Spain , by Don Miguel de Unamuno , Rector of the University of Salamanca . Suffrage Literature . The London Society issues a pretty little booklet giving its latest catalogue of leaflets , postcards , books , songs , and posters , etc. , to be obtained at 58 , Victoria Street .

Fisher Monk ; p.p. 352. ) " Mr. Wells can hardly write anything that is not clever and witty . " Ann Veronica " is both . It is a question whether the modern capacity for standing on one side and laughing at one's own opinions and one's own " cause " is not an immense disadvantage to the reformer ; but from the point of view of literature , it is invaluable , and Mr. Well's descrip- tions of the " salons , " at which the Higher Thought , the Simpler Life , Socialism , Humanitarianism are discussed by " the Children of Light , " are very amusing to read . Miss Miniver is a really convincing creation , with her pathetic and one - idea'd iteration of the plea that " there is no remedy except the Vote . " Indeed , the little Suffragette - perhaps because one has met her - seems nearer to life than any other character in the book , not excepting that essentially mascu- line conception , Anne Veronica herself . The really important issue of this book lies in the character and career of the heroine ; for Mr. Wells does not quite succeed in making us forget the reformer and " social student " in the novelist . Why should he ? He draws an admirable picture , the truth of which will be recognised by many women , of the " stuffy " atmosphere in which " young ladies " are so often brought up . He shows Anne Veronica suffering from imicality , conventionality , dependence , and all the ills which follow . The growing pains of the mind and character are described , and the fact that a stern parent for- bids attendance at a certain fancy - dress ball is made the pretext ( but not the cause ) of Ann Veronica's flight . The cause is given to us at the end of the book . " When first you left your home , " says Capes , " you had no idea that I was the hidden impulse . I wasn't . You came out like an ant for your nuptial flight . " " To think , " echoes the girl , " that it's not a full year since I was a black - hearted rebel school girl , distressed , puzzled , perplexed , not understanding that this great burst of love was bursting its way through me ! All those nameless discontents - they were no more than love's birth - pangs . " What is the matter with the world is that women should mate ( or remain unmated ) for any other reason than their free and unrestricted choice . That they should be compelled by economic causes , constrained by brute force , or restricted . by conventions such as the fact that the mate selected happens to have been already chosen ( and married to ) some- body else all these things are shown in " Ann Veronica . " to be equally odious . Woman must be given independence , economic , legal , moral ( if she is capable of it ) , in order that her choice may be as free as that of any female animal . At present this is denied her : hence her unrest . " It is true that Mr. Capes feels a little uncertain about all this . He is convinced that he and Veronica are " rather dis- reputable persons , " ( though " not coarse " ) , and even suggests that they have nothing particular to " give themselves airs about . But why ? Their conduct is all due to instinct , which , like the " child - expelling instinct " ( at the bottom of all family discords ) , or the " nuptial flight " of the ant , can be observed in working in the animal creation , and disobeyed only at the cost of grave inconvenience to ourselves . Ann Veronica is wiser . The abortive efforts of Capes to control his " instincts " merely amuse her . She permits him , with a smile , to make the attempt ; and when it fails , she laughs so

Once you begin with love , you have to see it through . " It is undoubtedly wise to begin by recognising that we are animals . But is it quite wise , Mr. Wells , to stop there ? Have you not forgotten some of the facts ? Because you have seen how women have suffered from being regarded as angels -idiots - male - labour - saving machines - must you add another to the list , and regard them as - animals ? There is another class ; and it is not their desire to be allowed natural sex - instincts that makes " black - hearted rebel school- girls " to - day , " distressed , puzzled , perplexed , " though this is part of it .

The Editor is not responsible for any statement made in the correspon- dence column . Correspondents are requested to write on one side of the paper only . ELECTION POLICY . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , It is with great interest and with some regret that I find from the current number of " The Common Cause " a definite opening of the question of the election policy to be pursued by Suffragists ; still more so to infer from the article entitled " Before the Country " that it may be expected of us Suffragists to put the cause of woman in the forefront of duty . I had hoped that this question might not be raised , and that we should be left to do as it seemed right in our own eyes without bringing suspicion on our loyalty to our more particular cause . I feel convinced that if a definite pledge to put the Suffrage before all other political questions be exacted of members of the N.U.W.S.S. the result will be not only divisions and secessions , but an estrangement of public sympathy . I think this suggestion of boycotting any candidate who is not pledged to us is symptomatic of that exceeding dreadful thing , that thing more unnatural and abhorrent than even civil war of sex war , -war between those whom God joined at the very moment that He made them twain . I know that our patience has been sorely tried ; that again and again our movement has been made to give way to ques- tions which men have , whether rightly or wrongly , regarded as of more vital importance to the nation , to the Empire , to the human race . I am well aware that unselfishness is easily mistaken for weakness , width of view for apathy and indifference ; nevertheless , I find myself compelled to urge on the attention of Suffragists , that at a time of such extreme moment in the history of our country , when a battle of principle is to be fought such as perhaps never before has been fought in the life of the civilised world ; when questions not only of international policy , but of international existence are at issue ; when freedom is actually at stake ; at such a time , I say , we should not put our personal interests nor our right to be represented before all other questions . Let us show our patriotism as our consciences direct us , whether as Socialists or as collectivists ; let us still trust to the best of men and the best in men ; let us beware of alienating them by pettiness . Men are increasingly respectful to us ; they are more and more recognising that we are grown - up , of age , that we are fit for the vote . If we show self - command and temperance during this national crisis we shall win more friends , and at the same time shall be making ourselves worthy of this supreme guerdon of citizenship . When at last let us hope at no such long last - we receive the prize , let not only our hands be clean from violence , but our hearts pure from malice , and our heads straight on our shoulders .

" Madam , It seems to me the longer your society continue to hold their meetings in Bermondsey the more popular do they become to the people here . Last Thursday night Mrs. Dice held a very large crowd at Tower Bridge Road , winning fresh laurels to those your society have already won . believe this was her first open - air speech in Bermondsey , but it was wonderful indeed to listen to the way she dealt with L

Many were the questions asked , but so ably did she answer them that One man asked her a rather the men were fully satisfied . silly question , and she said to him , " I am not here to answer silly and childish questions , " which brought forth this remark from another man , " She knows what she is talking about ; she's too ' ot for him . " After speaking for over an hour Mrs. Dice wished them all good - night , and many were the cheery responses from the crowd . Madam , how many thousands of young women there are in this country of ours who could do some little thing to help along this great cause , if they would . But some would say , We cannot all be speakers . " True , they need not be ; but they could by join- ing this society themselves , learning its principles , then speaking to their workmates with whom they have influence and getting them to sign ; in this way they would be doing good service to this society . - Yours , A LABOURER . BERMONDSEY ELECTION . To the Editor , " The Common Cause . " Madam , I have just read " A Labourer's " letter on the by - election in Bermondsey . It is astonishing what different views people hold on these matters . I was talking to a working - man on this election , and he said the working - men had been much annoyed by the action of the women in removing the petitions . He further said : " Working - men would have admired the women more if they had stood firm . " Most people cannot realise the number of societies there are for . Women's Enfranchisement , " and , unfor- tunately , all we who put " Votes for Women " in the fore- front our fight suffer through the disjointed efforts of all these societies . If , instead of repudiating each other , the heads of all these societies could meet and discuss their campaign it would mean greater success for " The Cause . " Yours , L. INGRAM MARSHALL . 35 , Hart Street , W.C. , Nov. 12 , 1909 . [ We agree with Miss Marshall that it would be a happy thing indeed if all the societies could agree to work on the same lines ; but since people ( men , just as much as women ) differ so much , is it not desirable that there should be separate organisations to suit the widely divergent views of suffragists as to what is and what is not permissible in political warfare ? -Ed . , " C.C. " ] MEMBERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL UNION . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , In a recent number you asked for opinions as to the desirability of anyone retaining membership in the National Union who is working for a candidate who has not given his adhesion to our cause . I should like to say my bias is in favour of no turning out . It is hard enough to get people who appear to be convinced to come to the point of giving their names and a small subscription . ( Members I think receive certain papers and notices , which keep workers and meetings before their minds , so that they are not wholly outside . ) When these are got , keep them ; that same individual can scarcely be openly opposed . I would also leave members all possible individual freedom . If their minds are of an order likely to influence others , they will probably presently find out for themselves what they can consistently do . It is perhaps a question of choice between an excluding outline and an accessible vague margin ; I am entirely in favour of margins of influence . - Yours , M. D. SCOTT MONCRIEFF . COMPARATIVE MAJORITIES . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , I note with pleasure your editorial remarks on Mr. Birrell's reference to the peers in moving to eject their amendments to the Irish Land Bill . He said they were " declaring war on the principle of representative government . " It is being asserted that the great Government measure of the year - the Finance Bill- goes up to the House of Lords with overwhelming force from the House representative of the present electors . The total vote , out of a House of 670 members , was 528 - ayes 379 , noes 149 , majority 290. It is desirable to point out that the vote " The Women's Enfranchisement Bill , 1908 " ( Mr. Stanger's Bill ) , was 363 - ayes 271 , noes 92 , majority 179. The latter Bill had over a three - quarters majority over in four ; the Budget had not . Put in another way : The present Liberal House mustered 149 against the Finance Bill , but only 92 against women's enfranchisement . - Yours , November 11 , 1909 . A LIBERAL . on FERRER ON VIOLENCE . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , May I draw your attention to the following quotation from an interesting article on Francisco Ferrer , by Alfred Naquet , in this month's " Nineteenth Century . " It may help to soothe the minds of those people who still have leanings towards stone - throwing : - " Ferrer's point of view had undergone a profound modifica- tion . The successive checks to all the Spanish conspiracies in which he had been involved , and his deeper study of the domestic quarrels which had ruined the Spanish Republic of

CAUSE . 423 The problem of the winter coat has been solved , and solved with absolute satisfaction to the world of women by " THE PERIVALE . " WILLIAM OWEN Westbourne Grove , W , who has prodnced a FUR - LINED COAT 3 GNS . CARRIAGE PAID . It is made of various coloured tweeds , lined good squirrel lock and trimmed with dyed epossum revers . collar and EXACT TO SKETCH . Mention " Common Cause " when ordering , please . Those ladies who wish a warm winter coat , suit- able for travelling or motor wear , which being light in weight , is equally suitable for walking will find this garment one that meets all requirements . WILLIAM OWEN Ltd. , WESTBOURNE GROVE , London , W. 1873 , had imparted a new direction to his political ideas . He had arrived at the conclusion that the employment of violence is useless ; that despite its apparent swiftness , it is the slowest method in the end . Without going to the length of accepting the doctrine of resignation , or adopting the passive resistance theory of Tolstoi - he was far from that , he believed that the surest and quickest road to progress was that pacific way which consists in transforming by means of education the conceptions of one's contemporaries . His ideas on certain points were quite different from my own . When I maintained against Ferrer my theory justifying the winning of political rights by violence , Ferrer used to reply to me with the utmost calmness : ' Time only respects those institutions which time itself has played its part in building up . That which violence wins for us to - day , another act of violence may wrest from us to - morrow . Those stages of pro- gress are alone endurable which have rooted themselves in the mind and conscience of mankind before receiving the final sanction of legislation . The only means of realising what is good , is to teach it by education and propagate it by example . ' And my noble friend never yielded an iota in holding these ideas . Every day they were rooted deeper and deeper in his mind . Every day he was alienated more and more from the idea of revolutionary action . " - Yours , November 15 , 1909 . PLEDGES . E. M. GARDNER . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , In an article in your last issue we are told that the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies would be stronger if all members of militant societies left it . This is certainly not the opinion of the Executive Committee of the London Society , as at the annual meeting on the 5th inst . a resolution was passed making a clear distinction between old and new members , and requiring that the latter only should take a pledge not to support societies which adopt illegal methods of agitation . I know that at least one amend- ment to make the pledge binding on all members was sent up in writing to the chair and was ignored . It is therefore clear that the Executive and the majority of the members of the London Society do not wish old members to resign , even though they support militant methods . Yours , W. M. BULL . November 13 , 1909 . [ Our correspondent has raised an interesting and important question . We are unable to say why the London Society requires a pledge from new members only . One , at least , of the largest societies in the Union makes it a simple

424 THE COMMON rule to admit no member of a militant society . Since members of the W.S.P.U. are required to sign a pledge supporting their objects and methods , it is hard to see how any consistent non - militant can belong to the W.S.P.U. Yet it is impossible and highly undesirable to be inquisitorial as to whether members attend meetings or buy literature , etc. , of the militant societies . Some such rule as the above is a plain solution . It is , of course , open to any society to suggest at the Annual Meeting of the National Union Council , when rules may be altered , that some such rule should be compulsory . We should then get at the general feeling in the country on this vexed question . - ED . " C.C. " ] MRS . FAWCETT ON PROTESTS . To the Editor , " The Common Cause . " Madam , I see in " The Common Cause " for November 11th that Mrs. Fawcett is reported to have said that " it will be both necessary and logical for women to protest in other ways if their just claims are persistently refused . " " I am sure I am also speaking for many other women when I say I am eager to hear what the " other ways are that the president of the N.U.W.S.S. would suggest , and how long it will be before it is logical to use them . - Yours , L. A. FLOYD . [ We think it unreasonable to ask Mrs. Fawcett what other ways she might think it necessary and logical to adopt in the dim and speculative future . No one can be reasonably called upon to state what she might do under all contingencies . We know what Mrs. Fawcett advocates now , and that is enough . - ED . " C.C. " ] THE ANTI - SUFFRAGIST PETITION . To the Editor , " The Common Cause . " Madam , The question in the mouths of Anti - Suffragists in Leicester , as they invite signatures to their petition , has been " Are you in favour of every woman having a vote ? " A great many women are not in favour of Adult Suffrage , and fall into the snare . On the same paper therefore appear the names of women who are ardently for , and of those who are strongly against , enfranchisement . Of what value is such a petition ? Yours , EDITH GITTINS . THE LONDON SOCIETY . Mrs. Pollard writes saying that she sincerely hopes there will be a large and very representative meeting on Saturday , November 20 , to discuss the resolution at the adjourned meeting of the London Society , and that she hopes the meeting will be conducted in a strictly regular and con- stitutional manner , so that people may have a chance of hearing discussions on the resolution and the amendment , and be able to record a fully considered vote according to their respective convictions . Reports of Societies within the National Union . Secretaries would simplify the work by sending in notices of FORTHCOMING MEETINGS , endorsed with those words , with time , place , and speakers legibly written , on one side of the paper only , and on a sheet of paper separate from other matter CARDIFF . It is quite impossible in a short paragraph to do justice to the excellent speech Miss Barke , M.A. , gave at the Star Street School- room , Miss Janet Price presiding . Starting with an exposition of the women's demand , Miss Barke treated the subject from the Liberal point of view , and showed that the enfranchisement of women is as the incoming tide - part of the national movement for progress , which can neither be averted nor long delayed . The rapt attention of the audience , their thoughtful silence , now and then broken by short bursts of applause , all the more impressive because of their brevity , showed that Miss Barke was putting good seed in promising ground . At question time no objections were raised , but a suggestion having been made to the effect that the women should join the Labour Party to secure their enfranchisement , Miss Barke explained the impossibility of such action so adequately as to leave no doubt in the minds of her hearers . RAMSGATE . A successful " At Home " was given by the committee on Saturday , November 13 , at 4 p.m. , in the Congregational Hall to members and their friends . The attendance was pleasantly large . After tea short addresses were given by members of the committee , two of whom spoke in public on Women's Suffrage for the first time . The results of the meeting , in the way of new members and contribu- tions to the funds , were highly satisfactory . ROYAL HOLLOWAY COLLEGE . A very successful meeting was held on November 14 , at which Mr. Lawrence Housman was the speaker . Mr. Housman , in the course of a clearly reasoned argument , showed the necessity for political freedom to raise the status of women economically and socially . He spoke of the difficulties in the way of this reform - the apathy of the Press and the hostility of party politicians - and urged his audience to take eonfidence in themselves and in their capabilities as citizens , and to unite to gain their political freedom .

CAUSE . NOVEMBER 18 , 1909 . The audience was large and enthusiastic , and it is expected that some new members will join the Society as a consequence of the meeting . NORTH - EASTERN . A very appreciative audience assembled on Tuesday , November 9 , when Miss Mein delivered an address at the Hexham Debating Society . The Rev. E. Greene , Hexham Abbey , presided , and after Miss Mein had stated her case for Women's Suffrage , there was an open debate , which , however , was not very keen owing to the absence of supporters of the opposition . Ladies had been admitted as a special favour , and two of them made their debut as speakers , arguing in favour of Women's Suffrage . There were no lady speakers against . At the kind invitation of Mrs. Brown , Sidney House , Consett , a drawing - room meeting was held on Friday , November 12 , when Miss Margaret Mein spoke . She carefully explained the policy of her Society , and at the end of the meeting , in reply to her appeal for new members and workers for the general election , there was a hearty response , everyone promising to help in some way . LONDON - HIGHGATE . By the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Rogers , an interesting Mrs. S. H. debate was held at Drumtochty , Cholmeley Park . Holman , in a clear and concise speech , defended the position of the Constitutional Suffragists . Having referred to the many civic offices held by women in feudal times , Mrs. Holman demanded the vote for them now , for the sake of the women in the home , for the sake of the women who earned their own living , for the sake of the children , and for the sake of the men . Miss Edith Durham , the well - known traveller and authoress , proved a spirited opponent . She said in her youth she had been a keen Suffragist , and had wanted the vote the day after to - morrow , but experience and travel had taught her the time was not yet . A brisk debate then followed , and it was encouraging to discover that even the Anti - Suffragists felt the enfranchisement of women was only a matter of time , though one wished to postpone it for thirty years , another for fifty , and yet another for centuries ! A resolution in favour of the Suffrage was eventually carried with seven dissentients , about four - fifths of the meeting voting for it . EDINBURGH - GLENFARG . This branch held a successful entertainment in the Public Hall , Glenfarg , on Thursday evening , 11th November . Mrs. Kirkland , of Fordel , took the chair . A lecture , illustrated by lime - light views , and entitled , " Camping in Mesopotamia , " was given by Mrs. Graham Stirling . Miss Lamond delivered an excellent speech , while vocal and instrumental music was loontributed by Mrs. Bisset , Miss Fleming , Mr. J. R. Stephenson , and Mr. Mapston . Miss Fleming and Mrs. Graham Stirling created much laughter in a dialogue , in which the latter , an old Scotch woman in favour of Woman Suffrage , completely worsted the former , who was a strong Anti - Suffragist . FILEY . The first public meeting of this branch was held in the Crompton Café on the afternoon of Friday , November 12. The speakers were Miss Abadam and Miss Kitson , the chair being taken by the Rev. A. N. Cooper , vicar of Filey . Mr. Cooper introduced the subject in an able and sympathetic speech , and Miss Kitson spoke of the advantage of joining the Society . Miss Abadam's address was listened to with great attention and interest by an appreciative audience . The room was well filled , and nine new members have already joined as a result of the meeting . Literature and " The Common Cause " were on sale , and a good collection towards the expenses of the meet- ing was taken . CROYDON - SPECIAL EFFORT . On Tuesday , November 9 , great crowds assembled in the streets to watch the picturesque procession of women carrying the beautiful emblems of " Women's Trades and Professions , " kindly lent by the London Society ( used by them in the Albert Hall pageant in the spring ) . Red , yellow , and green lanterns strung on poles twinkled amongst the emblems . Carriages gaily decorated with red and white were interspersed amongst the marchers , who swung along to the strains of a fine band . The big red - and - white banner of the National Union headed the procession , and its rear was brought up by the She Croydon banner , earried in front of the secretary's carriage . was greeted here and there with " That's Mrs. Pankhurst , " and " How about Bermondsey ? " but the general reception of the procession was very sympathetic . A big public meeting was held in the Pembroke Hall , where Mrs. Stanbury and Mr. Baillie - Weaver were the speakers , and the Mayor of Croydon took the chair . A big overflow meeting in the street outside was addressed by Miss Helen Fraser , who was so well known at Croydon during the by - election . On Wednesday the red - and - white sale was opened by Miss Abadam with an eloquent speech , and in the evening a crowded hall greeted " Press Cuttings " ( acted by Mrs. Fisher White's company ) with con- tinual peals of laughter . The sale continued on Thursday , and " How the Vote was Won , " the Anti - Suffrage waxworks , given by Miss Cicely Hamilton and other members of the Actresses ' Franchise League , caused much merri- ment . Speeches were given on both nights by Mr. T. Raphael and Mr. Stewart Robertson , and many professional friends daily helped with instrumental and vocal music . An " At Home " on Friday afternoon terminated the proceedings . The committee are delighted with the success which has attended their efforts . All the local papers have devoted columns to the account of their doings , and so a splendid advertisement has been Special gained , which was the principal raison d'etre of this " Week . ' New members have joined , funds have coma in , and the committee wish to express their thanks to all those who have so kindly co - operated with them in their endeavour to spread a knowledge of the cause . HASLEMERE , HINDHEAD , AND DISTRICT . On Monday and Tuesday , November 8 and 9 , Miss Bertha Mason gave her lecture on " The History of the Suffrage Movement , " in Grayshote and in Haslemere .

The beautiful slides were very well shown on both nights , and I think the feeling of the audience was well expressed by a working woman who exclaimed : " Well , them as stopped away has lost a great deal . " I wish all our members had been there , to be moved to greater zeal by the story of all that has been dared and done by the brave women whose portraits were shown us . Both our candidates are now in the field , and we are looking for- ward to an exciting time . We shall devote most of our energies now to preparing for the general election , and specially to working up the voters ' petition . FIRST MEETING AT ELSTEAD . The first Women's Suffrage meetings ever held in Elstead took place on November 12 at Bridge House , by the kind invitation of Lady Scott Moncrieff . In the afternoon the meeting was for women , and in the evening for men . Both meetings were very well attended . Lady Scott Moncrieff and Miss Costelloe were the speakers . The women seemed to want to " mind the baby " with their votes , and the men seemed to think that taxation and representation ought to go together . The plain justice of the claim , and the benefits that the State would derive , appealed both to the men and to the women . WALLASEY AND WIRRAL . This Society held a very successful meeting on Thursday , November 11 , at 3 p.m. , in the Old Schoolrooms , Poulton . Mrs. George Win- chester took the chair , and in her opening remarks made the position of this Society as a non - militant and non - party organisation quite clear . Miss Eskrigge gave a very interesting speech , giving very clearly the chief reasons for granting the Suffrage to women . Her reasoning was very closely followed by the audience , and afterwards there was some discussion . At the end of the meeting fifteen new members joined the Society , which now numbers 172 . NORTH BERKS . At a meeting held at Aston Tirrold on November 10 , by the kind- ness of Mr. and Mrs. Cross , a branch of the N.U.W.S.S. was formed . Mrs. Cross presided , and the Hon . Mrs. Bertrand Russell ad- dressed the meeting . She spoke of the neighbouring Women's Suffrage Societies at Reading and Oxford , and of the work of the latter , which had held fifty meetings during the past year , or almost one a week , and especially mentioned the meetings which had already been held in North Berks . She put before her hearers the advan- tages of joining the N.U.W.S.S. , and spoke of the double work of educating the people and of urging the matter upon the attention of the members of Parliament , which that Society was doing all over the country . If it was difficult for men to gain the reforms they needed , how much more difficult it was for women who had not the vote behind them . The difficulty of passing such a Bill as the Mid- wives ' Registration Act was a case in point . It had finally been brought in by the Lords , and passed with infinite difficulty after nearly a generation of delay . After the address a number of mem- bers joined the Society , which then proceeded to elect a committee and officers . The following were elected : -President , Mrs. Frank Cross , Aston Tirrold Manor , Wallingford ; vice - president , Mrs. Jessop , Sutton Courtney , near Abingdon ; hon sedretary , Mrs. Mayeston , Blewbury Manor , Didcot ; hon . treasurer , Mrs. H. Paxton , 18 , Park Road , Abingdon . NORTH OF ENGLAND - AUTUMN CAMPAIGN . We have had a strenuous week . Three public meetings have been held in Salford , all well attended - that in West Salford packed to overflowing . At all , our resolution , calling upon the candidates of that division to include Women's Suffrage in their election addresses , has been passed with only two or three dissentients , a large majority of those present voting . At Pendleton we inaugurated the crêche system - to the great relief of tired mothers , irritated speakers and audience , and bored babies : and now , to every meeting in a poor district , we go armed with teddy - bear and biscuits . The response we are getting from the working - men is most encouraging . It was a pleasure to see the faces of the South Salford men when they heard that their member , Mr. Hilaire Belloc , had declared , at a safe distance from his constituency , that if women were enfranchised the working - men would physically prevent their womenkind from voting . The shops have already more than justified their existence , though they are a heavy expense . Members flow in steadily , and the tone of the neighbourhood towards our question rapidly changes as they grasp our true aims and our policy . We are proud of our Society , for , during the week , we have had an average of fifteen helpers a day that is to say , members of the North of England Society and its branches have put in four or five hundred hours of voluntary work . Amongst the " novelties " of this campaign are our parti - coloured posters red , green , and white , in stripes - which are very effec- tive and our new leaflet - a simple exposition of our aim and non- militant policy which appeals to the man in the street . YORK . On Thursday , November 4th , a well - attended public meeting was held , at which the Lady Frances Balfour was the chief speaker . Every seat in the hall was occupied , and numbers of people stood the whole time , while many more came and were obliged to go away again because there was no room for them . Mr. Edwin Gray , who presided , introduced Lady Frances Balfour in a short and telling address . During Lady Frances ' address the whole audience listened quietly and thoughtfully . There was no great show of enthusiasm or applause until the end of the address , when the meeting showed its appreciation of the clear logic and sound argument that had been put before it . In proposing a vote of thanks the Hon . Mrs. Wilkinson spoke of the world - wide nature of the Women's Suffrage movement , telling of the interest she had found in the cause during a recent visit to Canada and the United States . In seconding the vote of thanks Dr. Macdonald called upon the audience to work for Women's Suffrage now , and at the next general election he predicted would be the day of their salvation .

CAUSE . NOTTINGHAM . 425 The market stall continues to be a success , and is an excellent centre for propaganda work . Miss Samuel , our new organiser , is getting to know the members , who call at it and buy odds and ends . Anything made by other branches or societies in the colours we would gladly sell , and anything anyone can send us would be doubly welcome , as we are getting short of things for sale . NORTH OF ENGLAND - KNUTSFORD . A wet and stormy night was responsible for a somewhat thin meeting in the Bollington Assembly Rooms on November 9th , only a couple of hundred being present . Mrs. Cooper , of Nelson , our chief speaker , was unfortunately taken ill suddenly , but Mrs. Earp kindly came forward at very short notice and gave a convincing address on the needs of working women . Men formed the majority of the audience , and a section were inclined to treat our resolution as a joke , but an appeal from our Chairman ( Mr. J. R. Tomlinson ) for serious treatment of a serious question was instantly responded to , and the resolution was passed by a large majority . Mr. H. G. Barclay , of Macclesfield , ably supported our resolution , and we have also to thank members of the Macclesfield Society for aid in stewarding . WARRINGTON . The first monthly " At Home " was held at the Winmarleigh Café on Saturday , October 30th . There was a good attendance , and a pleasant evening was spent . One of our members kindly made a quantity of sweets which had a ready sale in 3d . and 6d . packets . The I.L.P. invited our Society to address their members at their club on November 2nd . There was a crowded attendance . Mrs. Ransome took the chair , and Miss Waring's address was listened to with deep interest . Our stock of " Common Causes " was all sold out before the meeting began . Several of the men volunteered to act as stewards or help us in any way at a large meeting we have arranged on the 17th of January . SCARBOROUGH - MISS ABADAM'S CAMPAIGN . In connection with the visit of Miss Abadam to Scarborough , two well filled meetings were held , the first at the Adult Schools on November 11th . In this instance the speaker took as the title of her lecture , " The Vote as a Moral Lever , " which was an eloquent and enthralling account of her experiences in rescue work . Miss Abádam opened out a new field of thought to many present who perhaps had not hitherto considered how the influence of women in public life and politics might mitigate to a very appreciable degree the terrible " white - slave trade " of the streets of England . On the following evening she spoke to a large and interested audience at the Town Hall , Dr. Eyre , Vicar of All Saints , presiding . In the course of his introductory remarks the Chairman referred to the glaring inequalities of the present divorce law , which was simply a crying shame so far as a woman's point of view was concerned . Miss Abadam then delivered an address on " The Magnetic Vote . " The vote was a magnet , and it was only fair that women should have votes . A Government would promise anything if there was only the magnet of a vote in a person's hands . Miss Abadam concluded by moving a resolution which was carried with only two dissentients . During the two lectures 81 " Common Causes " were sold and the names of 17 new members registered - a happy augury for the growing interest in the movement . EDINBURGH - DINGWALL . A new branch of the Edinburgh Society has been established at Dingwall , where an " At Home was held on the 6th . A committee of seven ladies and gentlemen has been appointed , and the following officers : -President , Mrs. Macpherson , The Manse ; vice - presidents , Councillor Allan and Mr. R. Mackenzie ; hon . secretary and trea- surer , Mrs. Robert Munro , Westfield . BATH . The reception held in the " Rooms " on the 12th was an interesting one for the Society , as it was addressed for the first time by the president , Lady Lawrence . In her opening speech from the chair , she referred to a drawing - room meeting held thirty - two years ago in her house in London , at which meeting the Suffragists present quite expected an Enfranchisement Bill to pass during that session ! Her own brief retrospect of the women's movement , of which the present crisis is the inevitable outcome , was charmingly delivered , and was followed by a thoughtful and uncommon address from Canon Talbot . He dealt with the subject from an historic point of view , showing how many other great causes had been despised and misunderstood in the early stages of their growth . BIRMINGHAM . A series of drawing - room meetings has been arranged in Harborne by the energy of Miss A. Miles . Work has also been begun in Sutton Coldfield , where the new Midland organiser , Mrs. Mayer , has taken up her abode for a week . Her campaign there is to end with a public meeting on December 1. The Rugby Society is nearly formed , thanks to the energy of Miss Noel Wright and Mrs. Green , and should be ready in time to face the general election . A meeting of the Franchise Club was held on November 8 , when Miss Taylor gave an interesting address on " Women and the Bible . " There was a good attendance , and a long and serious discussion on the work of the Society , chiefly in reference to Miss Kirby's scheme of perfecting our organisation by means of Suffrage district visitors . NORTH HERTS - HITCHIN . The first public meeting held in Hitchin ( on November 11 ) by Constitutional Suffragists was crowded , many people being unable to find seats , but was seriously marred by a noisy body of young roughs in the rear of the hall . Lady Gibb and Mrs. Rackham both held their ground bravely against constant interruptions from the hooligans , who whistled , sang songs , imitated animals , etc. Lady Gibb said that the same prejudice which in the past had debarred girls from equal advantages of education with boys was now operating to exclude them from rights of citizenship , quoting George Fox as a pioneer of equality between the sexes . She also spoke with severity of the unfairness shown by the London Press in their reports of women's meetings .

426 THE COMMON Mrs. Rackham dealt with the low rate of women's wages , the in- justice of English law as between men and women , on interference by Act of Parliament with details of home life , and the refusal of the vote to women as bearing on these questions . Her brilliant and argu- mentative address , delivered with dignified serenity amid annoying and vulgar interruption , must have brought conviction to her more serious hearers . The usual resolution was put by the chairman , the Rev. J. Frome Wilkinson , and declared to be carried , few , if any , hands being held up to the contrary . A considerable number did not vote , many persons being obviously anxious to escape from a scene of disorder . Other Societies . IRISH WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION . On Tuesday evening , the 2nd inst . , a largely attended and very successful drawing - room meeting was held at Park House , Iona Park , Glasnevin , by the kind invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Vance , tc hear an address from Mr. Haslam entitled " The Rightful Claim of Women Re - stated . " Miss Buchanan , P.L.G. , was called to the chair . Mr. Haslam declared that , in his judgment , the movement for the elevation of women to their rightful position in the social and political scale , not only here at home but the whole world over , is one of the most transcendent in importance , to those who rightly understand it , that have arisen in human history . Mr. Haslam more particularly advocated the appointment of women to seats upon the Boards of every public institution which has women or children amongst its inmates , and that in all such cases , where a second doctor is required , that doctor should be a woman . They were greatly obliged to Mr. and Mrs. Vance for opening their house to them , and the help of Mr. Vance was invaluable . He hoped the day would come when they would have women in the Corporation to support him . They were anxious that their organ , " The Common Cause , " should be taken by everyone . An animated discussion , in which several ladies and gentlemen took part , followed ; after which Miss Buchanan gave an interesting account of her visit to Toronto , as a delegate to the Congress of the International Council of Women held in that city . BRISTOL AND WEST OF ENGLAND WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE SOCIETY AND WOMEN'S REFORM UNION . Two house - warming " At Homes " were held at the new shop , 49 , Whiteladies Road , Bristol , on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday evening , November 2nd and 3rd . In spite of bad weather there were good gatherings of members and friends . The spacious shop and committee rooms looked bright and pleasant , and were much admired . A short meeting was held each day , when addresses were given by Mrs. O. Spencer , Miss Bancroft , B.A. , and Miss Chapman , L.L.A. , Mrs. R. Talbot and Miss Tanner presiding . Miss Bancroft said there had always been a reactionary party who had formerly opposed the election of women on public bodies , which now they heartily promote . " So , " said she , " the Anti - Suffragists , too , are progressive , although , mercifully , that fact is hidden from their eyes . " The autumn programmes of both Societies were announced , and discussion followed on a proposal for sanitary reform for women , and on the possibility of some scheme of help for unemployed women in Bristol . MEN'S LEAGUE FOR WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE . LIVERPOOL BRANCH . This branch will hold its first monthly public " At Home " on Monday , November 29 , at 6 , Colquitt Street , from 8 to 10 .
