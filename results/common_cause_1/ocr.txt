See P.115 A Liberal First " Cause . Movement for Reform . 10 , 1909 . ONE PENNY . A Veteran of the Enfranchisement Movement . Towards the end of May , a letter was written by Mrs. Fawcett and signed by the honorary officers of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , con- gratulating Mrs. Julia Ward Howe upon her approaching ninetieth birthday . In it occurred the following passages : You were among the earliest to claim for women their rightful position as citizens , and the able , closely reasoned letters which you have during the past year contributed to the English Press on the subject of Women's Suffrage in the United States show that old age has not deprived you of the strength and alertness necessary to parry the blows of those who , while willing to appropriate and use everything which has already been won by women in their long struggle towards political freedom , yet waste themselves in a futile attempt to obstruct all further progress in the same direction . " You have in full measure the honour , love , obedience , troops of friends which should accompany old age ; and we desire to express to you our conviction that next to your own country there is none in which your name is held in greater reverence and affection than in ours . The Florists ' Grievance . It will be remembered that by a recent decision to include florists in certain factory Acts , the livelihood of the more skilled women florists has been threatened . They have protested and the Home Secretary has now appointed Judge Ruegg , K.C. , to be a Commissioner to inquire into the matter . Correspondence on the subject may be addressed to his Honour at the Home Office . Sleepless vigilance is necessary in these days for women to protect themselves against incessant encroachments on their liberty and power of earning and , necessarily , without the power of the vote , and with the prevailing poverty of women , the struggle for existence becomes harder and harder . A meeting of protest is being arranged in the Queen's Hall by Miss Gore - Booth and Miss Roper on July 7th . Supply and Demand in the Labour Market . One of the favourite statements of the Anti - Suffragists is that the vote will not affect wages , because wages depend on the supply of and demand for labour ; those who have read " Makers of Our Clothes " will be startled by the extraordinarily various rates of pay that obtain for the same work in the same neighbourhood ; but even if we admit the contention that there will be a uniform " market rate " of wages in one district , dependent on demand and supply , is it not patent to everyone who thinks that it is within the power of the makers and administrators of the laws to increase or diminish , artificially , the demand and supply ? Take , for instance , this outery among teachers that the education authorities are fostering , by bursaries and scholarships , the excess supply of trained teachers who crowd the market and keep wages low . Take , again , the increasing tendency to prohibit women from follow- ing certain employments , so that they are driven to crowding those which remain to them . Can anyone say that political power could not be used to alter these wholly artificial conditions ? The truth is that interference with economic liberty of contract is a more ticklish business than people are prepared to admit . It is almost im-

114 THE COMMON possible to forecast who will be hit in the long run and the only safe thing to do is to give those who may be affected the right to speak . Where women are hit and men do the speaking the results are not satisfactory . Married Women Teachers . We have received an interesting communication from a lady who has been a valued head teacher in a girls ' school for twenty years . In the new fervour for " keep- ing women in the home , " the Education Committee has taken upon itself to give this lady notice , and a local newspapers says she may now retire into the kitchen or join the ranks of the Suffragettes . " In truth , we can imagine of no better argument for the vote than such outrageous interference in private life . This lady , we are told , has a heaven - sent gift of influence over the minds and characters of young people " ; she has probably little experience in cooking and no taste or aptitude for it ; she can earn £ 150 a year by teaching , and afford to pay a thoroughly competent housekeeper ; whether she does so or not is surely a question for her and her husband to decide , and it is the grossest impertinence for outsiders to meddle in her domestic affairs . It is proposed to ren- der useless the experience of years , to deprive the teach- ing profession of an admirable member , to strive to make a bad cook of a fine teacher , and all for what ? In the sacred interests of the home ! Doubtless we shall be told this is a peculiar case , and one cannot " legislate for exceptions . ' But why legis- late ? Why are women alone to be dictated to at every step and told " this shalt thou do " ? Because of the future generation , we are told . " Land of hope and glory ! Mother of the free ! " When will men say and act these words - not merely sing them ? When will they realise that only free mothers have free sons ? The men of England are not free ; their love of domination shows it . Women , Children and Motor Cars . The Royal Automobile Club is , it appears , making representations to the Board of Education with a view to the promulgation of instructions to teachers in elementary schools on the subject of the dangers of motor cars . We would prefer to hear that the teachers in elementary schools were instructing the Royal Auto- mobile Club and users of motor cars generally on the dangers and terrors of rapid driving . Many drivers , relying upon their own wonderful skill and on the per- fection of their mechanism , drive as if these were the only factors to be taken into account and children , animals , old and infirm people and nervous women must all acquire a like firmness of nerve and fineness of judg- ment or be held guilty of " contributory negligence the event of an accident . In a recent case at Chester , where a fatal accident occurred , the driver was acquitted ; there was conflicting evidence as to his sobriety , but many witnesses testified to the terrifying speed at which he was driving and the young woman who was killed appears to have been unnerved by it , so that she hesitated and was lost . We know , of course , that hesitation in crossing a road may cause very serious and unpreventible accidents , but the sight of a motor driven at high speed is extremely terrifying to people with rather weak nerves and causes the dangerous hesitation or paralysis of the will . Inebriate Homes . " in There has been considerable disappointment and dis- couragement because it has been found that the inmates of Langho Inebriates ' Home are not all reformed . It should not be so . Anyone who knows what the drink habit is will understand that a patient who has been con- victed of drunkenness 149 times is a very unlikely subject for total reform . It is unlikely that she will ever be fit to be at large again . The ideal thing is to have homes where the curable shall be cured ; but in addition , it is surely important that it should be possible permanently to detain the incurable . It must even be cheaper in the end than to let them loose on the world to work havoc and breed disease .

CAUSE . JUNE 10 , 1909 . Another Nurses ' Congress and Exhibition . Ten years ago the International Council of Nurses was founded in London . It will meet on July 19th at Caxton Hall and on the four following days there will be a Congress and nursing exhibition . The International Council is a big thing , numbering over 20,000 nurses , and at this Congress many countries will be represented , including the United Kingdom , Germany , the United States , Holland , Finland , Denmark , Canada , Japan , and Cuba . At one of the meetings Mr. Haldane will address the Congress on The Nurse as Patriot " ; we presume he will speak chiefly on military nursing , though to us it seems that a nurse's work is as patriotic in the civil hospital and the workman's home as it is on the field of battle . Amongst those expected to be present at this session are Miss E. M. Hibbard , Superintendent of Nurses on the American Hospital Ship Maine in the South African War ; Mrs. H. D. Stone , representing the Spanish - American War Nurses ; Miss Take Hagiwara , a Japanese nurse , delegate from the Red Cross Society of Japan , who has been decorated for her services in the Chino - Japanese War and the Russo - Japanese War ; and other nurses who have seen active service ashore and afloat . Lord Sandhurst , Treasurer of St. Bartholomew's Hospital , will preside over a meeting where " The Rela- tions of Nursing and Medicine " will be discussed ; there will be a banquet at the Gaiety Restaurant presided over by Lord Ampthill , President of the Colonial Nursing Association , and a trip to Windsor . University Intelligence . At Cambridge the following women have acquitted themselves in Part I. of the Mathematical Tripos so as to deserve honours : -D . M. Abbott , Newnham ; D. Braginton , Newnham ; E. E. Cracknell , Girton ; A. I. Dilks , Newnham ; O. M. Ingle , Newnham ; O. F. Martin , Newnham ; I. M. Matthews , Girton ; M. T. E. Taylor , Girton ; V. H. M. Thane , Newnham ; and H. M. Town- send , Newnham . The successful candidates will now go in for places , and the list in order of merit will be published on the 15th inst . At London University Miss Mary Taylor Fraser , B.Sc. , has been appointed to the Lindley Studentship . The studentship , which is of the value of £ 100 , is open to students qualified to undertake research in physiology , and is tenable in the Physiological Laboratory of the University . Miss Euphemia Ramsay , B.A. , University College , has been appointed to the Gilchrist Studentship in Modern Languages . The studentship , which is of the value of £ 80 , is awarded to enable the selected student to follow abroad a course of preparation for the profession of modern language teacher . At a meeting of the Court of Governors of Manchester University held on the 3rd inst . it was decided to confer on Mrs. Sidney Webb the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature . Death of Mr. Price . Suffragists have lost a good and staunch friend in Mr. Thomas Price , Prime Minister of South Australia . Mr. Price was born a working man and spent his early years in Liverpool where he followed the trade of stone cutter . It is an interesting fact that he was actually employed in the building of Parliament House at Adelaide , where he afterwards sat as Prime Minister . Mr. Price , like all the men of worth in Australia and New Zealand , was a strong believer in women's suffrage ; he was also a temperance reformer and realized for how much the women's vote had counted in the causes of temperance and purity . Membership of the National Union . An inquiry has been made into the membership of societies within the National Union , and it has been found that those paying fees this year amount to 14,500 . There are probably at least 1,000 more to be added to these , since some branches of societies do not pay fees .

JUNE 10 , 1909 . THE COMMON Our Point of View . A Liberal First . Yes , I am a believer in women's suffrage , but I am a Liberal first and a suffragist second . " Is there a working suffragist who has not heard this strange statement scores of times ? On the face of it , it sounds so absurd ; like saying , " I am a Christian first and a believer in the law of love second . " But we know , it cannot be as absurd as it sounds , because we have heard it from the lips of people whom we are bound to respect . Let us try to understand what those who use it mean by it . Clearly some antagonism is implied . The speaker means that one or more of the following statements is true : 1. That to propose the enfranchisement of women would wreck the Liberal party , because the feeling in the country is against it , and the Liberals would be turned out of office if they seriously proposed to carry it out . 2. That to enfranchise women would wreck the Liberal party , because the majority of women , when enfran- chised , would vote Conservative . 3. That until all Liberals ( at least within the Cabinet ) are agreed , it is not only impossible to legislate , but unwise for any Liberals to press for this reform . 4. That the matter is unimportant and can well afford to wait . The particular speakers we have under consideration can only be thinking of party , not of principle , because they have begun by admitting the principle . examine these statements . " Let us The feeling in the country is against it . " There is scarcely any statement made more constantly by all parties and with more reckless disregard of facts than this one that " the country " is for or against a certain movement . Any party newspaper will prove you that the country is for its party in the teeth of any facts you like to marshal . The statement is rarely worth much . It is worth nothing when it is made by the opponents of a movement who never trouble themselves to attend its meetings . But even if we did not , as we do , hold more meetings all over the country than are held for the promotion of any other reform ; if we did not , as we do , almost invariably pass our resolutions at public meetings and after allowing questions ; if we had not had the largest petition on record and forty - two years of steady propaganda , and the absolute self - sacrifice and devotion of more women to this than ever there were men to any other electoral reform ; it would yet not be just to re- present the inertia of the mass as opposition : in the claim for an admitted right , the sense of those who are conscious is of infinitely more importance than the sluggishness of those who are but half awake . Those who say the feeling in the country is against us are those who take the least trouble to discover what the feeling in the country is : members of Parliament whose " sympathy resolves itself into a curt affirmative when directly ques- tioned , followed , if they speak , by a long tirade against the methods of one particular section only of the agitators . " " " The majority of women would vote Conservative . " One's first impulse is to express amazement at the assur- ance of the augurs . One is then led to wonder how it is that it has been left for Liberals alone to see so far into the " eternal " feminine and that the Conservative oracle is silent in the matter ; for surely if it were certain that the majority of women would vote with the Con- servatives , their party machine would have long since been set in motion for us . But next , consider the immorality of the statement . It really means that the Liberal is unwilling to give the vote to those who , he believes , will disagree with him . So that the vote , the legitimate and honourable expression of opinion , is to be given only to those whose opinions will chime with his . He will say : Free " But my opinion is the right one . Trade is a matter of such supreme national importance that the country cannot afford to risk losing it . " The


### Column 1

CAUSE . 115 Conservative , on the other hand , says : " Imperial defence is a matter of such national importance that " So that what it really comes to is this , that those who have the power say , as they always have said : " We know what is good for you better than you know your- selves . Liberty is dangerous ; the power to express your opinion and your will is illusory ; we would give you the vote if we thought it would be for your good and for the good of the community , but though we cannot deny the abstract justice of your claim , we feel sure you would vote wrong and therefore we withhold the vote until the day come when we shall feel sure that you will vote right . " And this is our latter - day Liberalism ! Why , this has been the stumbling - block of man , his pernicious delusion down all the ages , that he thinks he knows better than God and his conscience ; that he vainly imagines he can forecast the future ; that he can afford to abandon the one sure and steadfast light of Right for the shifting rays of Policy and that he can serve the best interests of the community by imposing his dominant will . If man has a conviction , there is every reason he should express it , but none that he should attempt to silence the expression of contrary opinions , even though , from the nature of the case , he must think them wrong . " All Liberals are not agreed and therefore it is unwise to press for this reform . " If this had not been gravely stated in one form or another by several Cabinet Ministers we should dismiss it as too palpably an excuse to need discussing . Our friends do not explain how the matter is ever to get any further , if those who believe in it do not press it forward . We ask nothing peculiar of these " favourable " gentlemen ; we only ask that they should treat this reform as they treat all reforms for which they really care , that they should advocate it publicly and that they should take part in our educa- tive propaganda and receive deputations which ask to be heard on the question . CC " The matter is unimportant " and can well afford to wait while men alone attend to the really important things and get them all settled without the help , or the interference , " of women . This is at once the most widespread and serious ground of inactivity and the strongest argument we could possibly advance for action . Consider for a moment : how can a serious woman tolerate with patience the statement that certain matters are so important that she need not think about them , or that if she thinks and comes to a conclusion about them she may not speak ? It is just because these matters which men are now settling alone are so important that we care so much about them . It is because we think that they never will be satisfactorily " settled " by men alone that we ask to be taken into consultation . We suffer . Can they not see it ? When a woman listens to men's talk of politics and the ways of parties and poli- ticians , how they will rub raw , bleeding wounds , how lightly they will play fives with human lives and claims , her heart aches at it and she thinks " truly this is no world for women - this men's world , " and she feels she must alter it without delay . Men go on legislating " in the interests of women " and bit by bit they take away the poor means of subsistence left them , the poor remnant of liberty that goes with economic independence . Even if the legislation were absolutely wise and just ( which it is not ) those who understand the foundations , ethical or psychological , of representative government know well you cannot get the best out of a beneficent law unless you take the people with you ; anti - suffragists are fond of threatening us with a positive war between men and women , when women shall vote all one way and men all another ; but there is a more subtle and injurious war- fare threatening , if men refuse to women the right to a voice in the laws by which they and their children and their homes are governed . It is not so shocking nor so obvious , but we are not sure that the injury will not be far more insidious and deep and ineradicable . " CC Then , " say these Liberals , you are asking us to make women's suffrage the dominant issue . " We answer , " Please yourselves ; we don't ask it . " No one can believe that it would wreck any Ministry that introduced it ; no one believes the country would turn out a Ministry on it ; it would be impossible for the Conservatives to go

116 THE COMMON solid against it , with their leader and many of the rank and file in favour of it . The Liberals have allowed their Prime Minister to create the situation out of which they find it so difficult to get ; it is none of our making . He told us that he was prepared to enfranchise women if we could show a demand for women's suffrage in the country ; we proceeded to show it ; he then said he would not give the thing we asked for namely , the vote on the same terms as men - but something quite different and very like adult suffrage ; there is undoubtedly no great demand for this and any proposal of this nature would certainly be thrown out by the House of Lords . But if the Liberals bring in their Reform Bill and leave the women out , they are lost . The country will realize that they are indeed not Liberals at all , either first , second or last ; that they have not understood the meaning of the great tradition under which they profess to serve and that they deserve the support of no party and the devoted labour of no woman . Is it not time , then , that the conspiracy of silence were broken and that the Men's Liberal Associations all over the country took the matter up seriously ? Topic of the Day . Infant Mortality . III . Feeding of Infants . The whole subject of infant feeding and management is of the utmost importance in considering the causes of infant mortality . Throughout the length and breadth of our country there is nothing so important as the saving of our babies , and if our babies continue to die off like flies and at the same time our birth - rate goes on decreasing , not only at home , but in our Colonies , the natural result will be that , as a nation , we shall eventually cease to exist . It was the cause of the decline of ancient Greece and Rome , and if allowed to continue will inevitably bring about the fall of the English Empire . And so , while the more excitable people of our nation cry only about the building of more Dreadnoughts and the greater efficiency of our army , the more thoughtfully inclined will turn their attention also to the protection of infant life , because if there are no healthy infants in the present there will be no men and women in the future . no And yet , throughout the country , there is no subject on which men and women are so ignorant as on the feed- ing and rearing of infants . The ordinary mere man turns from it contemptuously as being woman's province " woman's sphere as if paternity involved responsibility ; the ordinary woman enters upon the duties of maternity quite heedlessly , and in the majority of cases , without any accurate knowledge of the way in which her children ought to be fed . Every day one is struck by the ignorance , or at best by the elementary and fragmentary knowledge possessed by the modern young mother , of the way in which her baby ought to be reared , and how she depends upon instinct , upon her doctor , or her more or less trained nurse , to teach her . Training is required in every other rôle of life , but in the most important of all a happy - go - lucky state of affairs exists , and there is no need to wonder at the untold amount of suffering and destruction endured by the least protected member of the community - the human infant . And here , we say without hesitation and after many years of a varied medical practice amongst all classes , that the Suffragist mother scores . However many faults our opponents may impute to us , however unsexed and unwomanly we have become by speaking on public plat- forms ( except when Lord Cromer takes the chair ! ) , they must grant that women suffragists think , and also possess knowledge beyond the average woman . And so we find that when maternity comes to a suffragist she has informed herself , both theoretically and practically , of the method of feeding and rearing her baby . No proper one is so keen on proper instruction , no woman asks so many intelligent questions on the bringing up of healthy children , no woman is so accurate in carrying out the

This , surely , is an additional reason why the vote should be granted to women , so that more may be taught to think and to realise that our very existence as a nation depends on the health of the babies . Improper feeding is the cause of mortality from infantile diarrhoea , from the diseases of dentition , and from much of that due to convulsions , tuberculosis , atrophy , marasmus , and debility . Proper food is more necessary in the first year of existence than in any other , in order to build up new tissue . It is a miraculous fact that a properly fed infant trebles its weight during its first year ; that is to say that an ordinary healthy baby weighing 7lbs . at birth ought to weigh 14lbs . at six months and 21lbs . at twelve months old . This extra- ordinary rapidity of growth is never approached in after life . Human milk is the best food for human babies . It is a wonderful food , and it is not possible to find a satis- factory substitute . It ought to be the only food for the first eight or nine months of an infant's life . The pre- mature weaning of a child is in reality a pathological process . Dr. Chapin , of New York , says : " From a physiological standpoint the artificially fed child is a premature child , and anything but maternal milk is foreign to its digestive tract . " In the process of digestion , cows ' milk clots with a firm , hard clot , but human milk in clotting forms a soft , finely divided mass . In chemical qualities the difference is also striking . The German physiologist , Professor von Bunge , has carried out systematic researches in milk in various countries in Central Europe , and he assures us that in inorganic salts the mother's milk resembles the tissues of the young animal , and that it contains all the " inorganic con- stituents needed by the infant in the exact proportions best adapted to further its growth and development towards the adult form . " The making of milk is a living process , depending on the activity of the milk secreting cells of the breast , and the milk of each species is specialised to meet the needs of the young animal . Human milk is rich in a substance called lecithin , which forms a large part of the brain and nerves , and so the mother - fed baby is a more intelligent animal than its hand - fed brother or sister . Milk is a living liquid ; it contains many soluble ferments on which the process of digestion depends , and they stimulate and regulate the infant's nutrition . The mother's milk contains also protective substances called " anti - bodies , " which pro- tect the baby from various bacteria which produce disease ; that is to say , they confer immunity on the infant . Sucklings possess a marked immunity from infectious disease . The mothers may contract scarlet fever , diphtheria , measles , etc. , and though they continue to feed their baby , it is almost unknown for the baby to get the disease . This immunity is said to last two years , and of course , a baby is much more likely to combat infectious diseases and survive after that age . That the mother - fed baby has a much better chance of survival than the artificially fed one is the opinion of all medical authorities in every land . One additional fact may be cited to induce mothers to follow Nature's rule : it has been recently demon- strated by German observers that the " omission of suckling has an important bearing on the marked increase of cancer of the breast . " " The enormous activity of the milk - producing cells and the whole struc- ture of the breast cannot lightly be ignored and the whole function stopped without producing grave degenerative changes . It is therefore the evident duty of every medical practitioner to encourage every mother under his or her charge to feed her own child , and by careful dieting of the mother herself , to ensure that her milk is of good quality and quantity for the first nine months of the baby's life . Much may be done by constant personal encouragement on the part of the medical attendant , but an ally is not always found in the nurse , who often finds it less trouble to resort to the bottle and the artificial food . An unexpected opponent is sometimes found in the father of the child , who , in his newly found paternity , cares less for the baby than for the mother ;

" THE COMMON up . to he imagines that his wife's health is suffering from lactation and encourages her to give it Every medical practitioner of any experience is brought face to face with the fact that breast - feeding becomes increasingly difficult to secure , and the baby becomes parasite of the cow . " This is partly more and more a due to social and economic conditions ; the poor mothers earn their living , and are often so badly fed that it is impossible for them to secrete sufficient milk of good I social duties quality ; the rich have too many perform to attend to the most important duty of all . During the siege of Paris , in 1870-71 , the infant mortality fell to 40 per cent .; this has been attributed to the fact that mothers were compelled to suckle their infants , but we must remember that there were many food - stations where nursing mothers received special treatment , and were better fed than in ordinary times . The same holds good of the Lancashire cotton famine , when the infant mortality was low , but " food require- ments were met by universal charity . " I remember well the Hull dock strike of 1893 , when the thin and haggard The mothers brought up their babies for treatment . mothers were the chief bread - winners , and also nursed their own infants ; the babies maintained a fair physio- logical condition , but it was years before the mothers recovered and many succumbed . I feel most strongly that the salvation of the race lies in the feeding of the infants by their own mothers , and those of us who have any power in the matter must concentrate all our energies on educating public opinion , on bringing home to the parents their national responsi- bility , and demonstrating to them on every possible occasion that it is on their paternity and their maternity that we rely for our future citizens . M. C. MURDOCH , L.R.C.P. In Parliament . Short Time . The House of Commons reassembled on Thursday , 3rd , and went into Committee of Supply . Mr. Snowden protested against the fining of certain post - office officials who had given information to the Press contrary to regulations , and Mr. Hobhouse explained that no one had been fined without previous warning . On Friday the discussion turned upon the London Elections Bill and it is interesting to note how much sympathy Mr. Harcourt has for a man who loses his vote for a space of time on removal , although he has none to spare for a woman who never has a vote all her life . The Bill passed its second reading by a majority of 94 , and was referred to a Standing Committee . It seems the Government can find time to pass this Bill although no one can say it is not contentious . The Co - operative Congress at Newcastle . The impression gained by the independent observer at the sittings of this Congress is that there are distinctly two schools of thought , and a middle section trying to reconcile the two schools , and trying more or less unsuccessfully : - one school representing the business side , and being so immersed in that side as not to be able to see the ideals of the movement , or at least not seeing their way to reconcile the business side and the human side , and regarding the co - operative movement as an aggregation of individuals , each one looking at affairs from the point of view of the individual unit , either person , society , district , or section , and seeming , as in the discussion on overlapping , to be quite incapable of seeing further than the individual unit , and the possible effect of new regulations upon that The other side , the idealist section , seeming impatient of the slow pace , and a little sore that the business side could not appreciate ideals or practise them ; not having the prac- tical experience of dealing with a vast mass of business de- tail , these were apt to belittle it . unit . The Chairman of the Congress , Mr. W. R. Rae , did his best to reconcile the two sections to make each stand off from its own particular work and look at the work done by the other section , and try to understand the difficulties of the position . His presidential address gave one the thought , " Hitch your waggon to a star , " but like the canny Scot " be sure to keep a good hold of the reins and try to avoid sharp corners , and take special care at dangerous crossings .

The latter resolution read as follows : " That this meeting affirms the necessity of the removal of any hindrance to the development of women socially and politically , and in children educationally , of the best of which they are capable . " Miss Pease , who is a member of the North - Eastern Society for Women's Suffrage , moved the resolution in a very good suffrage speech , which the local papers did not report , and which , owing to the vile acoustic properties of the Town Hall , could not be heard in every part . Like the other women's speeches , it was a contribu- tion of expert knowledge . Mrs. Brown , who seconded , did so as representing the embodied opinion and the authentic voice of the Women's Co - operative Guild . The exhibition of co - operative productions was exceedingly interesting . Five years have elapsed since a similar exhibi- tion was held in the same building , and there was a great change in the furniture and women's clothing , both exhibits being much improved , the furniture being still what it appears and not a sham , and having a beauty and a dainti- ness which is an added joy to the housewife . The clothing , under and upper , for women and children , was of sufficient variety in kind and price to satisfy all that great portion of the community who have to work for their living . These improvements in what is distinctly the women's sphere are most encouraging evidence of the fact that women co - operators are taking a greater and more intelligent in- terest in the great movement of which they form so import- ant a part .

118 THE COMMON Yorkshire Organisation Committee . As the work of organisation in Yorkshire proceeds , we realise how inadequate the amount received up to the present is to carry out the work that should be done in this county of " broad acres . " As the treasurer of the Yorkshire Committee I appeal to all Yorkshire women to do their share in the work of edu- cating every town , village , and hamlet to the need of Women's Suffrage , by contributing to the fund . Any sum , however small , will be gratefully received and judiciously expended . The following sums have already been received : Whitby ... York W.S. Society Miss E. Bateson Mrs. Heron ( Whitby ) Miss True ( Loughton , Essex ) Miss Thornton Hull W.S. Society £ s . d . 6 11 0 10 0 0 5 0 0 1 1 0 0 10 6 500 10 0 0 C. KIRK , Treasurer , 152 , Park Avenue , Hull . Caravan Tour . The caravan starting on Monday , June 7 , will be due at Ripon on Friday next , June 11 , and will remain there until Monday , 14th . Would any sympathiser in Ripon offer hos- pitality to our speakers there ? In the absence of our trea- surer , who has gone to the International Women Workers ' Congress at Toronto , we are appealing most urgently for funds , as the expense of horse hire in this hilly district is a very heavy item ; in fact , the tour cannot be carried on for so long as we had hoped unless more donations are received at once . They should be sent to Miss Rowland , 82 , Marl- borough Avenue , Hull . As the horses will be our heaviest expense , and as they will be changed at each stopping place , any offers of the loan of horses would be most valuable . They would be returned the same day . Our caravan started from Whitby on Monday morning , June 7th , on its tour through the North Riding . Its splen- didly fitted interior was a source of great interest to all , and it attracted much attention The fates were kind and the weather all that could be desired , the " sinews of war " came in well at each meeting and our hopes are set high for a successful and prosperous campaign . We held three good meetings on Monday , one in the Station Square , Whitby , after which the van left with a hearty send - off . The speakers were Miss Pringle , Miss Fielden , and Mr. H. Seddon . The van then went on to Sleights and held an excellent afternoon meeting with the same speakers , and in the evening , one on the village green at Goathland . Miss Gill at Cardiff . I have been for a month in Cardiff , where the Society is one of the youngest within the National Union , but is also one of the most energetic . Drawing - room meetings have been held in all parts of the town , and also in Llanishen , and parts of the town have been canvassed almost from house to house . We have also had public meetings in the different districts , and ended up with a very well - attended meeting in the Lesser Andrew's Hall . Mrs. Lewis ( Green Meadow ) , president of the Society , took the chair . Miss Cicely Corbett , B.A. , Mr. Joseph Clayton , and I spoke . Mrs. Gregory , president of the Pontypridd Society , proposed a vote of thanks , seconded by Mr. Hubback , Professor of Greek at the Cardiff University . During self - denial week the members have been indefatig- able in their efforts . Some have cleaned gloves , others cut out blouses , while some mowed garden lawns . result is not yet known . Miss Fraser in Elgin . The financial HELGA GILL . The work culminated in two public meetings in Elgin Town Hall and one at Lossiemouth . To judge from the local press , Elgin was amazed that Miss Fraser did not come on to the platform hoarsely shouting and brandishing an umbrella . It was virgin soil , however , and much must be forgiven to people who had never heard a real Suffragist speak . The reasoning Scot was evidently impressed by Miss Fraser's eminently reasonable way of putting things . At Elgin , Miss Hay , of Lossiemouth , supported her . At Lossie- mouth , Provost Watt presided . Miss Fraser will return in September to complete the formation of a branch and mean- time Miss Stuart , Fleurs , Elgin , will act as secretary . A Suffrage Club . It is proposed to establish in London a Women's Suffrage Club . Among the originators are Mrs. Despard , Lady Strachey , Mr. Cecil Chapman , Mr. Bertrand Russell , and Mr. Zangwill .

CAUSE . JUNE 10 , 1909 . The Compleat Organizer . IV . The Young Society . We will suppose that the nucleus of a society has been formed . The organiser , who has been so actively engaged in calling , holding meetings in drawing - rooms , at mills , in squares and halls , as described in our first three articles , has found her local secretary and a small committee , has entered some names as members of the infant society , and has de- parted , leaving everyone very anxious indeed to carry on her work , and the secretary , if she is inexperienced , feeling rather like a young mother when the nurse has , for the first time , left her alone with her baby . The first thing the secretary must do is to call a committee meeting for the earliest convenient date , and when the time comes she should be at the place of meeting a little before- hand to see that the table and chairs are in readiness , and that there are writing materials to hand . She should her- self , of course , be provided with a note - book and pencil . Someone present is voted into the chair pro tem , and the first business is to elect a permanent chairman of committee . In some places it is thought advisable to choose someone of social standing and influence for this position , even if she can scarcely ever attend . But the position of chairman of an Executive Committee should not be one of mere adorn- ment ; it should be filled by someone with a capacity for work , who will attend meetings constantly , and is intimately acquainted with all the work , and will direct and influence the policy of the young society . It is a much better plan to put your non - working notabilities into the posts of president and vice - presidents than to have a chairman who has to be constantly informed of what has been going on in her absence . It is well to ascertain beforehand who is willing to be nominated as chairman , and if more than one name is pro- posed and seconded , it is best to proceed to vote by ballot . If the secretary has reason to anticipate that there will be a vote , she should prepare slips of paper , and when everyone has voted and folded his or her paper , the secretary should having declared the result , the newly elected chairman should collect and count the votes , and the chairman pro tem . then take the direction of the meeting . If an hon . treasurer has not been chosen , this is the next post to be filled . Accounts are not likely to be very complex , but someone of methodical habits should be chosen , and it is important that attendant at committees , since a large part of the success the treasurer , as well as the chairman , should be a regular of the work depends upon the committee and the members fully realising the importance of its financial side . In a large town or a straggling constituency it may be necessary to appoint more than one secretary , but if this is done , the duties should be carefully apportioned , and each secretary know exactly what she is responsible for . We know what it is to have thought So - and - So would do it , " whereas she was under the impression that we had done it " long ago . When the officers have been elected it becomes necessary to pass the rules . If the secretary is wise she will have drawn up a set for consideration , and if they have stood the test of some other similar society , they should not need much altering . " Few rules and stick to them " is my advice . It is well to begin with the name , object , and methods of the Society . Affiliation with any other should be mentioned , terms of membership and regulations concerning the management of affairs and the election of officers . Some societies have a minimum membership fee and some have not ; as long as it is clearly understood that it is a minimum , it is sometimes well to have it , but I have no hesitation in condemning the establishment of a maximum . Another rule which often " seriously hampers a society is one making a quorum a neces- sity for transacting business ; I have known a society held up for a whole year because there never was a quorum . One member of committee is sufficient to transact business , and if she remain sole , her first business should be to " C meet for the purpose of " adding to her number " some members who will work . The committee should , of course , be , in the main , elected , but it should have power to fill vacancies as they occur and to co - opt a limited number . It will doubt- less be convenient to determine a time and day for regular committee meetings ( which should be at least once a month ) , but this need not form part of the rules , and the secretary should have power to call committees ( with due notice ) whenever there is business of sufficient importance to trans- act . 66 If the society is to be affiliated to the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , it is important that all its mem- bers should understand the policy of the National Union . The usual rule is that those can become members of the society who approve of the object and methods , " and who pay an annual subscription . The object of the National Union is to obtain the Parliamentary franchise for women on the same terms as it is or may be granted to men . " The methods are " by orderly propaganda and public discussion to put the question before the electors so that they may press it upon members of Parliament . " There is nothing in either of these statements to show that the work of the Union and its constituent societies is non - party , and it would be difficult to draft rules for societies which should provide

JUNE 10 , 1909 . THE COMMON for this and not be liable to misconstruction . The situation is this : Anyone of any party who desires to work for the object of the Union in constitutional ways may join the society and work also in his or her own party ; but the society as a whole works for no party , and , at an election , the society takes sides for or against no party , but works for the man who will do most for women's suffrage , where such a distinc- tion can be made , and remains neutral where it cannot . It will be seen , therefore , that there is nothing to prevent the stoutest Tory or Radical from joining the National Union and continuing to work within his or her party . No member of the society is even bound to join the society's work at a by - election , though since this work is undeniably the most effective of all possible work , the keenest members will not wish to be outsiders at such a crisis . I have given this long explanation because so many people seem to think that to be non - party means that you never take a line at elections ; we do take a line , but it is not a party line , unless , indeed , you admit the existence of the Woman's Party . One word more about membership . Make your members feel truly that they are members of each other and of a great communion . To do this , you must give them work , and you must provide means of meeting and of communica- tion . Some work is quite unskilled ; some needs more or less training and education . Make use of all your members and train those that are capable of acquiring training . Subsequent articles will deal with various methods of putting members to good use , and with the duties of chair- man , secretary , and treasurer . There will also be articles on the conduct of public and private meetings and debates , the press , the work of divisional secretaries , by - elections , deputations , and other practical matters . Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association . 48 , Dover Street , Piccadilly , London , W. Correspondence has passed between Mrs. Gilbert Samuel , hon . secretary of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association and Mr. Arnold Ward , Central Conser- vative Association , Watford , and 25 , Grosvenor Place , S.W. , from which it appears that the Association aims at carrying out a purely educational work , and does not make the ques- tion of the franchise a party issue or a ground for opposing Unionist candidates , though it does not undertake , as an association , to work for any candidate opposed to women's franchise . In response to an appeal to Mr. Ward for support of the objects of the Association ( which were set forth in an accom- panying circular ) , Mr. Ward pointed out that the Unionist leaders had refrained from making women's franchise a party issue , and that an attempt by the Association to make it a party issue seemed likely to promote discord among Unionists . Mr. Ward added : -- " It would be interesting to know whether your Associa- tion proposes to support or oppose Unionist candidates accord- ing to their views on women's franchise . If this is your intention , how do you reconcile it with party loyalty ? If it is not your intention , what can be the object of the letter which you have circulated ? " Mrs. Samuel , writing in reply from 48 , Dover Street , Piccadilly , W. , on May 26 , said : - " The executive committee of our Association beg me to assure you that they are most grateful for your letter , which has given them an opportunity of making clear to the public the aims and objects of their Association . " We are quite aware that opinion on the subject of women's franchise is divided in the ranks of both political parties , and that the Unionist leaders have refrained from making the question a party one , and have left individual Unionists free to approach it from a non - party standpoint . ' " No attempt has been made by our Association to make this question a party issue , as will be seen by the leaflets which always accompany any written communication we address to members of Parliament , candidates , or possible supporters . The main objects of the Association , as stated in our circular , are : - " ( a ) To work for Women's Enfranchisement by educative and constitutional methods consistent with Unionist principles . " ( b ) To maintain the principles of the Conservative and Unionist Party with regard to the basis on which the fran- chise should rest , and to oppose universal Suffrage in any form . CC The circular further intimates that the Association pledges itself not to oppose any official Unionist candidate , though , of course , it cannot be expected , as an association , to work for any candidate opposed to women's franchise . " This makes it clear that the position we take up is quite consistent with party loyalty . " The Association was , in fact , founded with the object of expressing the views of those members of the Unionist Party who , while strongly supporting the cause of Women's Suffrage , yet would not join any non - party association for fear of injuring other causes dear to the hearts of all Unionists . " Our object in addressing to candidates the question con- tained in cur first letter to yourself is to obtain the neces-

Lord Beaconsfield , the late Lord Salisbury , as well as many of our present leaders , have individually declared themselves in favour of the enfranchisement of duly - qualified women , but the party as a whole could not be asked to adopt the policy without a clear preponderance of opinion in its favour . " Mr. Ward , in his letter of acknowledgment , wrote on May 28 : - " It is satisfactory to learn that your Association does not intend to oppose official Unionist candidates , but in view of the strong opposition to your objects existing within the ranks of the party , I must adhere to the opinion that the work of your Association is not calculated to promote har- monious relations , but rather to divide the members of a great party whose first imperative duty it should be to ignore points of difference , and to work all together for the triumph of its accepted principles . " " This correspondence has also appeared in the " Morning Post , " Daily Telegraph , " and other papers . The first informal social meeting of the Kensington Com- mittee took place on the 4th in Miss Luxmoore's studio . In spite of the bad weather there was a good attendance of members and their friends . Miss Eva Mackenzie and Miss Bell were the speakers . Miss Mackenzie dealt ably with anti - suffrage objections , and Miss Bell made an excellent speech on the Suffrage generally . An animated discussion followed , and several suggestions were made for future work . The next social evening will take place a fortnight hence , when it is proposed to hold a debate with a member of the Women's Anti - Suffrage League . The speakers will be announced next week . We are holding an important meeting at the Oratory Studios , 16 , Fulham Road , on Thursday , 17th , at 4.30 , by kind permission of Miss Colton . Lady Lockyer , chairman of the Kensington Committee , will preside . The speakers will be Lady Betty Balfour , Lady Strachey , and Mr. G. A. Touche . Miss Edyth Olive , of the Actresses ' Franchise League , has kindly consented to give some of her beautiful recitations . We shall be glad to welcome any members and friends outside the Kensington Committee , if they will apply for invitation cards , enclosing stamped envelope for reply , to the hon . secretary , Miss Myra Luxmoore , 57 , Bedford Gardens , Kensington . The Artists ' League for Women's Suffrage . 259 King's Road , Chelsea . An attractive window bill has been designed by Miss Joan Drew which should have a good sale . It represents woman offering her gifts at her country's door . A graceful figure of a woman , carrying a basket of fruits , stands knocking at a formidably bolted and barred gateway . Space is left for announcements of meetings , with time and place . The price ( 1s . 6d . a dozen ) is very moderate and buyers could easily do some hand - tinting to make the bill more striking . We now want a design suited to Mammoth posters , leaving rather more space for print . The National Women's Social and Political Union . 4 , Clement's Inn , Strand . Now that the Exhibition in the Prince's Skating Rink has been brought to a successful issue , the members of the Women's Social and Political Union have returned with a new vigour to the more political side of their campaign . In order to make the deputation which is to wait on the Prime Minister at the end of this month as large and repre- sentative as possible , a very extensive campaign is being carried on in the Metropolis ; this is modelled as closely as possible upon a by - election campaign . Committee Rooms have been taken in 13 districts in the Metropolis , organisers appointed and lists of meetings arranged ; great open - air demonstrations are being held in all parts , as well as meet- ings in many of the principal towns near London . The Drum and Fife Band of the Union , which attracted so much attention during the Exhibition , will visit each district in turn , and will take part in processions . Mean- while the At - Homes in the Queen's Hall and in the St. James ' Hall are being carried on . Next Monday , June 14 , Miss Gertrude Kingston is to be the speaker , and the follow- ing week , Ellis Griffith , Esq . , M.P. , will address the At - Home in the Queen's Hall . On June 14th a meeting has been arranged for the benefit of the business men in the City . This will be held at 6.45 p.m. in the great hall at Winchester House , Old Broad Street , E.C. Two days later , on June 16th , Miss Patricia Woodlock will be released from Holloway Gaol , where she has been serving the long term of three months ' imprison- ment for her action in joining the deputation to the Prime Minister earlier in the year . She will be met at the Prison Gates by members and friends of the Union , and will be entertained at a public breakfast at the Inns of Court Hotel , at 9.15 a.m. The same evening there is to be a great pro- cession to Hyde Park , where a mass meeting will be held .

Office : 40 , Museum Street , London , W.C. The Executive Committee met on Tuesday , June 1 , Mr. Herbert Jacobs in the chair . The work of the Literature and Open - air Sub - Committees was discussed , and a proposal to circularise the London members with reference to the pro- jected deputation to the Prime Minister on June 29 was adopted , the form of the circular to be considered by the Parliamentary Sub - committee . A suggestion for the forma- tion of a legal sub - committee was considered , and is likely to be carried into effect very shortly . Such a sub - committee might well prove to be one of the most valuable means of increasing the usefulness of the League ; it contains already a considerable number of lawyers , and both by readiness to give expert advice if asked for it and by focussing the legal facts of the movement it may do good service . An informal gathering of members interested in the work of open - air speaking was held the same evening in Mr. Jacob's chambers , with the object of improving the organisation , which tends to leave an inordinate amount of work to one or two members . The open - air meetings in the London parks have been most successful , and it is felt that the League ought to be able to extend its campaign so as to include at least a considerable number of the suburban parks as well . These meetings are invariably well attended , and if we have a complaint to make it is that our audiences are more respectful than those of the women speakers . We are cheerfully accused of promulgating every sort of anarchical doctrine , political and moral ; but it is done , as a rule , with as much civility as the rules of the game permit . We do not have to face anything comparable with the disgusting ribaldry which a woman speaker has to stand from young men engaged in supporting the chivalric view of the relations between the sexes . The The Literature Sub - committee met on Wednesday , June 2 , in Mr. Cholmeley's Chambers , 7 , Gray's Inn Square . principal business discussed was the preparation of leaflets and the revision of the list of representative men in favour of women's suffrage . It is hoped to issue this list with addi- tional names in a convenient form before long , and also some new penny leaflets for distribution at open - air and other meetings . Mr. Housman suggested that any member who had occasion to give up his seat to a lady in train , tram , or ' bus should thereupon present her with a leaflet . This was felt to be a very reasonable stroke of humour , and it is hoped When you that many will see it and act upon the hint . come to think of it , one of the objects for which the League exists or at any rate one of those which justify its existence is to show that advocacy of Women's Suffrage is , from one point of view , just part of the right way to treat women . Magazines for June . WHAT TO READ . The National Review publishes an article entitled " The Woman Problem , " by the late Mdlle . de la Ramée ( Ouida ) , written more than 25 years ago with a view to publication after her death . Though by no means written from the suffragist point of view , it is very interesting as indicating the growing tendencies in the early eighties which have led to the present wide - spreading revolt of women against their position .

REPORT OF THE FIFTH CONFERENCE and First Quinquennial of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance . Price 1/3 . ( To be obtained from the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies . ) This report is well worth possessing , if it were only for the verbatim report of Mrs. Chapman Catt's address . The minutes of the business meetings are useful also as clearing our minds on points which we may have forgotten , and we strongly recommend those who may hear or read any com- plaints of the proceedings to read these minutes before coming to a conclusion . A quotation from the President's address will show the intention which regulated her conduct " Since I came here I of the stormy debate on April 30 : have received a great many letters asking me to condemn militant tactics in my address , which of course is expected to present a bird's eye view of the situation , and I have received a great many others asking me to uphold them . Now I have no intention of doing either , but I also have no intention of evading the question . As an International body we must not take sides in a contention over methods in any country , and here in England there is an intense difference of opinion about this matter , and you and I , delegates of this Convention , if we are courteous , diplomatic , just , if we understand what Internationalism really means , will be silent concerning our opinions upon that issue . " This then , was the ground upon which the President ruled out of order an amendment which would , if passed , have committed the Congress to an approval of militant methods and if rejected have committed it to a condemnation ; either of these , the President held to be a violation of neutrality and the meeting upheld her ruling . DAPHNE ; OR MARRIAGE A LA MODE . By Mrs. Humphry Ward ( Cassell & Co. , 6s . ) . Mrs. Humphry Ward has abandoned even the vain pursuit of art , and is making use of the novel as a form more con- venient than debate or public speech for the insinuation of her peculiar point of view , and in order to attribute ugly motives and opinions to those with whom she is in disagree- ment , without danger of contradiction ; for Daphne's cap fits no honoured or much followed Suffragist . We cannot , therefore , review the book as a work of art , but merely touch upon the " moral " which it is supposed to carry . In " Diana Mallory " Mrs. Ward gave us a red - haired , eye- glassed Suffragist , who deserted the sick beds of her nearest relations in order to be present at " feminist congresses . " In " Daphne " the heroine , after wrecking what might have been a happy home , finds scope in the Women's Rights cam- paign for the expression of her restlessness and egoism . Daphne " is the story Like many of Mrs. Ward's books , " of an unhappy marriage , a marriage founded on self - interest But in her and physical passion , on everything except love . eyes disaster is made inevitable , not by the very nature of the marriage , but by the state of public opinion which per- mits its too easy dissolution . According to Mrs. Ward , the young Englishman who married Daphne because her money was necessary to keep up his family place , would still , with due encouragement , have made a good husband . He loved Roger , his child , and , notwithstanding appearances to the contrary , he is faithful to Daphne . But Daphne cannot trust him . She is seized with fierce jealousy and desire for freedom , and in America , with some use of perjury and corruption , she obtains a divorce and the custody of her child . deserted by Daphne and deprived of his daughter ( who after- wards dies ) , takes to drink and develops consumption . Then Daphne is stricken with remorse , but it is too late . Roger is dying and does not want her . She cannot atone for the evil she has done . " You see , " Roger says in the final inter- view , " marriage is a big thing . If it doesn't make us , it but I ruins us . I didn't marry you for the best of reasons , was very fend of you , honour bright ! I loved you in my I should way ! I should have loved you more and more . I had all have been a decent fellow if you'd stuck to me . sorts of plans ; you might have taught me anything . I was a fool about Chloe Fairmile , but there was nothing in it - you know there wasn't . And now it's all rooted up and done with . Women like to think such things can be mended , but they can't they can't indeed . It would be foolish to try . " Foolish , indeed , if this was all he had learnt . It does not seem to occur to Mrs. Ward that Roger , as well as Daphne , had need of repentance . In marrying a woman he did not love for the sake of her money , he had been guilty of perjury and corruption . He had thought such things could be mender , and had found himself mistaken .

JUNE 10 , 1909 . THE COMMON really be mended in this world by repentance , forgiveness , charity , we do not yet know , but not much can be done while it is expected that these graces should be all on the side of the woman . Mrs. Humphry Ward - if we do not entirely misunderstand her thinks that women owe a special debt to the family , and that when they act with selfish individualism they are more guilty than men who do the same thing . It is their province to teach ; men who have given them no reason to trust them , may yet depend on them for both faith and guidance . If a woman placed in these cir- cumstances fails , the man becomes her victim , " and not only his loss of happiness , but his moral degradation lies at her door . Such a theory seems to us false and destructive of family life . No individual has a right to make his salvation depend on another , even if that other does happen to be his wife . When in " The Amazing Marriage " Meredith describes the cruel suffering of a woman from the selfish individualism of a man , he does not suggest that Carinthia's desertion by her husband made it inevitable for her to lapse into moral de- terioration . To imply that husbands may justly shift their moral responsibility on to their wives is to proclaim men as inferior creatures . Such a low view of the duties and capa- bilities of half the human race is more fatal to marriage than the most corruptly administered divorce law , and while agree- ing with Mrs. Ward's condemnation of individual selfishness , we cannot help wishing that she thought better of the moral possibilities of men . Foreign News . GERMANY . The monthly supplement of Women's Suffrage news which forms part of the German newspaper , Die Frauenbewegung , is edited by Dr. Anita Augspurg . Those who were present at the International Congress will therefore not be surprised to find in the June number a very heated attack upon the conduct of the Congress by Miss Heymann of Munich . She complains that the Congress decided not to include in the Alliance societies which were working for the enfranchise- ment of men as well as of women and she considers the rule requiring that membership should be calculated only upon those who pay an annual subscription to be oppressive . But no woman exists so poor as not to be able to pay the minimum yearly subscription to a society and we heartily disapprove the system adopted by Anti - Suffrage Societies of " once a member always a member , " even if you have never done a stroke of work and have never paid but one fee of a shilling . Miss Heymann's attack upon the chair was not made at the time when it was challenged and we may leave it to fall to the ground , harmless in the eyes of all who witnessed Mrs. Chapman Catt's admirable impartiality .

The Editor is not responsible for any statement made in the correspon- dence column . THE COMMON CAUSE " AND FREE LIBRARIES . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , In this week's " Common Cause " it is suggested by Miss Fraser that Suffragists should place the paper in the free library of their town . Some of us in Penrith com- menced to do this last month . When we took the second paper the librarian offered to give us back the week - old one . We gladly accepted her offer , and decided to take it to the ladies ' waiting room at our railway station , where people are often reduced to reading the time - table for want of something better . Perhaps others could do the same , as the " Common Cause " is much too good a paper to be thrown away only half worn out , and at a railway station many might be introduced to it who would afterwards regularly order it . Yours , 5/6/09 . NANCY E. HART , 28 , Musgrave Street , Penrith . A FABLE FOR ANTI - SUFFRAGISTS . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , Lord Curzon's " fifteen solid reasons one of the fox and the cat . remind Cat and fox were standing talking at the root of a tree . " How is it , " asked the cat , " that you are so often hunted and never get caught ? " " Don't be uneasy about me , " said the fox , " I have fifteen good tricks , and one or other of them is sure to bring me off safe . " This depressed the cat . " Fifteen good and valid tricks ! I must say I envy you , " sail the cat . " I have only one ! " said the poor cat .

CAUSE . 121 Then the hounds came . The fox apparently used the wrong trick for the occasion , for the dog secured him . The cat , using her single argument , immediately flew up the tree and watched his fate with regret from the branches . And it has generally been considered that one valid excuse is better than several . - Yours , THE WOMEN'S CHARTER . M. BATY . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , -- I should like to explain that when the resolution proposed by Lady McLaren was moved by me and seconded by Dr. Jacobs ( Holland ) , at the International Congress , it was understood that no such charter was to be presented to the different Parliaments of each country . That portion was altered from its original wording , because the business of the Congress is obtain the vote , not to enumerate , officially , women's disabilities . But each country was asked to draw up , if it wished , an account of women's disabilities , and make the women of those countries realise them fully . Then , when they claim the vote , they can do so with a full understand- ing of why they claim it , and can make their Governments understand those reasons also . To introduce such a charter into the House of Commons was not included in the resolu- tion , as I understand it , or as Dr. Jacobs understood it . But as a scheme of work for women to undertake , amongst other schemes , it was considered an excellent idea . - Yours , Adel Grange . ISABELLA O. FORD . [ Miss Ford is perfectly correct in stating that the Con- gress did not propose that the Alliance or any of its con- stituent National Societies should present a Women's Char- ter to Parliament . Lady McLaren did not state that it had done so . She said ( see " The Common Cause , " May 27 ) , " I have prepared and circulated the preliminary draft of such a charter suitable for England , which it has been resolved to introduce into the House of Commons early in the session of 1910. " Lady McLaren did not state who had resolved or who was to introduce it.-Ed. , " C. C. " ] REGISTRATION OF NURSES . ( To the Editor , " The Common Cause . " ) Madam , With reference to your article headed " Registra- tion of Nurses , " may I ask you in fairness to make mention in your paper of the protest approved by the Central Hospital Council , which has already received the signatures of 229 matrons , 1,790 nurses , 278 medical men , and of 74 men and women engaged in hospital work and having to do with nurses . I enclose a copy of the protest with the preliminary list of signatures . - Yours , SYDNEY HOLLAND , Chairman , London Hospital . Kneesworth Hall , Royston , Herts . June 2 , 1909 . PROPAGANDA BY CONTRARIES . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , May I add a word to your notice of the Chiswick debate on May 13 ? The epithet hurled by a certain section of Suffragists is the vilest one - see any dictionary -- that can be applied to any woman . It is charitable to suppose that Mrs. Somervell used it in ignorance of its meaning , but surely the secretary of an important society , a frequent speaker at public meetings , should know the meaning of the words she employs . Her violent language gained at least two recruits for the London Suffrage Society . - Yours , CAROLINE T. COXHEAD , L.S.S. , 10 , Riverview Gardens , Barnes , S. W. 4th June , 1909 . * * * * A lady signing " Neutral no longer " also writes to con- demn Mrs. Somervell's violent language , and declares that it caused her to abandon neutrality . QUEEN ELIZABETH AND THE SUFFRAGE . To the Editor , " The Common Cause . " Madam , Suffrage is in the air ! As custodian of an old historic house in this city , I have this year revived an ancient custom of wreathing Queen Elizabeth's portrait and the gallery of this house for the Trinity Festival . The portrait is probably decorated in remembrance of Elizabeth's bene- faction to the school at one time connected with this build- ing ; three circles of evergreens and flowers represent the Holy Trinity , and three golden balls are the attributes of S. Nicholas of Myra , in honour of whom there is a church in this district . The custom of this wreathing seems unique , and has attracted some attention . I was asked by one questioner " whether it had anything to do with Suffrage ! " - Yours , THE CUSTODIAN . Old Trinity House , Worcester .

122 THE COMMON Reports of Societies within the National Union . Secretaries would simplify the work by sending in notices of FORTHCOMING MEETINGS , endorsed with those words , with time , place , and speakers legibly written , on one side of the paper only , and on a sheet of paper separate from other matter . NORTH EASTERN . This week's activities began on Monday , 25th , with a very large meeting at the dinner hour at one of the many gates of the great Elswick Works . Mrs. Simm opened the meeting , and as she has addressed an audience at the Crooked Billet several times before she was given a most cordial reception . Miss Mein followed . She , too , was very well received , and made a very good impression . In the afternoon of that day a good drawing - room meeting was The held at Cullercoats by the kind invitation of Mrs. Nisbet . speakers were Mrs. Wilkinson and Miss Margaret Mein , B.Litt . , and several people were present who had never been at a Suffrage meeting before . On Wednesday , the 26th , a meeting for members and friends was held at Wallsend . Miss Steven acted as hostess . The speakers were Mrs. Simm ( who presided ) , Mrs. Waldie Cairns , B.Sc. , B.Litt . , . and Miss Margaret Mein , B.Litt . As this meeting was organised for the purpose of revivifying the Branch at Wallsend , there was some discussion as to the work to be undertaken , and amongst other points raised was the view that the Society was " too Liberal , " one of the members of the Primrose League expressing the opinion that no other party politicians were welcome . As it happened the three speakers were themselves the best answer , as Mrs. Simm is Labour Party , Mrs. Cairns Liberal , Miss Mein Conservative , and Miss Stevens non - party . On Friday , 28th , a drawing - room meeting was held by the kind invitation of Mrs. Jevons . Mrs. Waldie Cairns and Miss Mein were the speakers . Miss Robinson , Abbey House , will be glad to receive the name of any lady or gentleman who would like to join in the work of the Society at Durham . On Saturday , 29th , Mrs. Cooper came from Nelson to address a great mass meeting in the Haymarket . Mrs. Waldie Cairns presided on a waggon kindly lent by Mr. David Adams , of the firm of John Adams and Son , and was supported by Mrs. Shaw and Mrs. Harrison Bell . This meeting formed part of the special Conference work of the National Union , and a very large number of co - operators who are attending their Congress in Newcastle this Whitsuntide were present at the meeting , Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Harrison Bell being both well known in the co - operative world . Several thousands of leaflets were distributed and a collection was taken . The meeting , which lasted two hours , can best be described as a great meeting , and the same adjective would describe Mrs. Cooper's speech . The Treasurer has already in hand £ 3 for the Special Effort Fund . Some cards are still out , and Mrs. Wilkinson will be pleased to receive donations for that fund at 6 , Grosvenor Place , Newcastle . The Society feels that its members should try to help the National Union Fund as well as fulfil their local responsibilities . A speakers ' class is in course of formation , as many more are needed to keep the work going . WORCESTER . This Society has challenged the Anti - Suffrage Society to a public debate on June 25th , Lady Isabel Margesson to propose that it is desirable , in the interests of the State , to remove the disability of sex in the Franchise , granting it to women on the same terms as it is or may be granted to men . " The Anti - Suffrage Society have declined to oppose , on the ground that no new arguments would be advanced on either side , and that there would be danger , owing to the necessarily personal nature of a public debate , lest the friendly relations existing at present , locally , between the opposite sections should be impaired . A meeting , and , we still hope , a debate , will , however , be held on Friday , June 25th , at 8 p.m. , at the Co - operative Hall , Worcester . HULL . A cake sale was held on Wednesday , May 26th , at 83 , Park Avenue , the residence of Mrs. Coysh ( treasurer ) . Miss Coward provided a charming musical programme which was cordially appreciated by the numerous visitors , and Dr. Murdoch brought a pleasant afternoon to a close by an inspiring and invigorating address on " Suffrage in Many Lands . " The proceeds of the sale will be given to the York- shire Organisation Fund . CUMBERLAND - CARLISLE . A good meeting was held here on Wednesday , June 2nd , in a room belonging to the Girls ' Friendly Society . The audience numbered about forty . Miss Mabel Fell , who had arranged the meeting , was in the chair . Miss Catherine Marshall , Hon . Organizing Secretary of the Keswick Women's Suffrage Association ( N.U.W.S.S. ) , gave an address on " Women's Suffrage : what we want , why we want it , and how we are working to get it . " Mrs. Slack , President of the Keswick W.S.A. , spoke briefly at the close of the meeting and urged those present to start a branch of the National Union in Carlisle . A good deal of literature was sold and arrangements are in progress for the formation of a local Organizing Committee . Lady Frances Balfour has promised to visit Carlisle in October . CROYDON . On Thursday June 3rd a drawing - room meeting was held by the kind invitation of Mrs. Richards , the wife of one of the leading doctors in Croydon . Mrs. Rackham spoke on " Why Women Need the Vote , " and an excellent discussion took place . It is noticeable that since the establishment of a branch of the Anti - Suffrage Society here many more questions have been asked at these private meetings and a much greater interest in the subject has been aroused . Several new members joined and a number of " Common Causes " were sold . On Saturday June 5th by the kind invitation of Mrs. Wiener a meeting was held at Henley . In consequence of the bad weather the speaking took place in the house instead of the garden , as had


### Column 1

CAUSE . JUNE 10 , 1909 . been intended . The chair was taken by the host and most excellent speeches were made by Miss M. Ransome and Dr. Clarke , M.P. , on Why Women Need the Vote . " Miss Ransome dealt especially with the economic side of the question , and Dr. Clarke with the historic aspect . Miss Crickmay , the local Secretary , explained the methods of the N.U.W.S.S. and appealed for support of all kinds during the " Suffrage Week , " to be held during the second week in November , when a " Red and White " Sale will be held , meetings " Man and Woman " and " How the Vote arranged , and the plays , was Won , " will be given by Mrs. Fisher White's company , and it is hoped by members of the C.F.L. A good deal of literature was sold , and the Society is much indebted to Mr. and Mrs. Wiener for holding the first meeting of the kind in Henley . BIRMINGHAM - SPECIAL EFFORT WEEK . we cannot The collecting cards have not all come in yet , and there are still some entertainments to be held to raise money , so announce the total sum yet , but we wish to acknowledge with thanks the following sums , collected or given : Miss N. H. Wright £ 1 , Mrs. Tyndal 10s . , Mrs. E. Taylor 2s . 6d . , Miss R. Sidgwick 2s . 6d . , Miss Margesson 2s . 6d . , Mrs. Buckley 4s . , Mrs. Dowson 16s . ( sub . ) , Miss Perkins 5s . , Miss Humphries 3s . , Miss Heath , LL.A. , 4s . , Miss G. E. Southall 12s . ( sub . ) , Miss Rosser 7s . 6d . , Miss Vaughan 3s . , Mrs. Green 3s . 6d . , Miss Synger 2s . 6d . , Mrs. Pelham Lane 10s . , Miss Joyce 4s . , Miss A. Lowry £ 1 6s . 6d . , Miss Bowler 5s . , Mrs. P. Cross- key 12s . , Mrs. Hughes 12s . , Mrs. Wilson Sturge 4s . , Miss McCrea 6s . , Miss Kirby and Miss Lowndes £ 1 7s . 6d . , Miss F. Rathbone £ 3 3s . , Miss Portway 2s . , Miss Dobbs 1s . 6d . , Miss Perry 2s . , Mrs. Langley Browne 10s . , Mrs. Lemmon 2d . , H. Kirby , Esq . , 2s . 6d . , Miss Potter 5s . , Mrs. Walsh 9d . A meeting was held at Knowle on June 4 on the village green . After appalling difficulties in advertising we collected a very good crowd . Mrs. Yoxall made her first outdoor speech with great success , many " Common Causes " were sold , and a new member ( a man ) secured . The meeting at Kings Norton had to be given up , as we could not get permission to speak where we intended on that night , and our second speaker did not turn up . Mrs. Cooper is now in Birmingham for a month's outdoor cam- paign . There will be a meeting every dinner hour and every evening . Volunteers to sell badges , etc. , and to form the nucleus of a crowd are badly needed . We also want volunteers to go out with the motor car during Miss Costelloe's campaign beginning June 22 . Names should be sent to the office , 10 , Easy Row , as soon as possible . NEW FOREST ( HANTS . ) . The first annual meeting of this Society was held on May 19th with Miss Mabel Anderson in the chair . A report of the past year's work and statement of accounts were read and adopted . The Society now numbers about 185 members . As a result of a Special Effort Appeal £ 10 has been collected for the funds of the National Union . Miss Clough was elected President of the Society . The names of Miss Margaret Bernard , Mrs. Peto Shrubb , Mrs. Henry St. Barbe , and Miss Grant Robertson were added to the Committee . The proceedings concluded with the reading of a thoughtful and interesting paper by Miss F. E. Straker , to whose help we owe the inauguration of our Society , just a year ago . FLEET ( HANTS . ) . Despite a very wet day the Garden Meeting on June 2nd was attended by over 100 , a marquee being provided . Mr. Baillie Weaver gave a very impressive address , and was followed by Lady Betty Balfour and Colonel Pennycuick . Several of the men present joined the Men's League forthwith . SCARBOROUGH . On Wednesday , June 2nd , a drawing - room meeting was held at Belgrave House , by kind invitation of Mrs. John Byass . Miss Kitson occupied the chair . Miss Christina Bremner gave an extremely interesting address on the good influence exercised by women voters on the Governments of their countries , where the franchise has been granted to them . NOTTINGHAM - SPECIAL EFFORT . If Branch Societies would report how they got money in Special Effort Week it might perhaps be suggestive for the future . Ours was as follows - so far : Collecting cards returned , about £ 9 ; proceeds of garden sale ( wet day ) , about £ 18 0s . 6d .; market stall , £ 8 10s . 11d .; meeting at Radcliffe , 18s . 6d .; ladies ' luncheon , £ 2 5s .; concert , class , etc. , £ 3 5s .; total , £ 42 . Expenses , about £ 4 10s . A private sale is very little trouble or expense . Members will all send some- thing . If each member collects the things in her house that she can easily do without and sends them , they sell well either at the sale or at the market stall later in the week . Several concerts , etc. , in one week , clash to some extent ; it is better to spread them over a longer time . LITTLEHAMPTON , SUSSEX . The first of a series of open - air meetings was held here on the 2nd inst . The climatic conditions were far from favourable but in spite of this a very fair audience assembled and gave the speakers , Mrs. Stanbury , Miss Rendel and Miss H. D. Cockle , an attentive hearing . The meeting passed the usual resolution , copies of which are being forwarded to Mr. Asquith and Lord Edmund Talbot . The Anti - Suffragist atmosphere of Littlehampton is decidedly bracing , and this no doubt accounts for the satisfactory progress the move- ment has made during the last few months . REDHILL , REIGATE AND DISTRICT . The annual meeting was held on Monday , May 24th , at Redhill . Miss Crosfield took the chair and referred in her opening speech to the great loss sustained by all Suffragists in the death of George Meredith . A report was read of the Society's work for the year in which an increase in membership from 81 to 182 was reported ; fourteen meetings had been held in the course of the year , and a branch Society started at Horley , while help had been given to the starting of a new Society at Leith Hill . The financial report showed urgent need for more funds . In the discussion that followed , a project for taking a house for the official headquarters of the Society was mooted and approved .

JUNE 10 , 1909 . THE COMMON Mr. E. Francis then read a paper on " The Need for the Vote , and How Best to Win It , " and in the course of the discussion that followed the Secretary was censured by Mr. Harley , Redhill , for sending out notices of a W.S.P.U. meeting held in Redhill with the official agenda of the local Society . A resolution was passed to the effect that such notices should be sent out , but should be marked " unofficial . " Owing to the lateness of the hour the meeting broke up without discussing the last subject on the agenda . EASTBOURNE . A very successful dramatic performance was given in the Town Hall on Wednesday , May 19th , when it is hoped that good work for propaganda was effected by the clever acting of members of the Brighton and Hove Franchise Society in Mrs. J. Ward's play , " Man and Woman . " This was followed by the production of " Mr. Biggs ' Dream , " a sketch specially written for the occasion by Miss L. M. Cooke and carried out by local actors . There was a good attendance and an excellent impression was created . JUNE 10 . Forthcoming Meetings . HARLESTON , Open - air Dance at " Caltofts .
