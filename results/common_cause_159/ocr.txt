Notes and Comments . The Ladies ' Gallery . As most readers of the COMMON CAUSE probably know by experience , the Ladies ' Gallery in the House of Commons is not only a spot from which it is difficult either to see or hear what is proceeding below , but one in which also it is laborious to breathe . Those Suffragists , therefore , who have sufficient patience to frequent that place of penitence will be glad the authorities have endeavoured to fulfil the promise which was made some time since , that the ventilation of the gallery should be improved . An " ozonair apparatus " has now been installed for the purpose of purifying the air , which passes by a special duct to the Ladies ' Gallery ; and , if the " results secured " found satisfactory , the First Commissioner will consider the question of allowing similar advantages to the members on the floor of the House . Good air in the lungs being , we under- stand , very helpful to the proper working of the brain , we are looking forward with hope to a great improvement in the tone of debates when the ozonairs are breathing gaily on every member's countenance . The Meeting in the Albert Hall , Manchester . are Owing to a slight misunderstanding , the report of the joint meeting held by the National Union and by a number of other women's societies in Manchester on the 10th inst . was omitted from last week's COMMON CAUSE . The large hall was packed , and the speeches were heard with the deepest attention , and with very evident sympathy . Miss Ashton , Mrs. Fawcett , Mr. Snowden , Mr. Laurence Housman , and Professor Chapman spoke - all excellently - and only two hands were held up against the resolution that : " This meeting urges the House of Commons to pass no Bill extending the franchise that does not include some measure of enfranchisement for women . " A meeting so large , so unanimous , and so impressive cannot fail to produce an effect both in and beyond Manchester . Ancient Monuments . It is distressing to learn that " at the present rate of progress the labours of the Royal Commission on Ancient Monuments will in all probability take some forty years to complete , " by which time Captain Murray , M.P. , very reasonably , apprehends that many such monuments will have " perished or have been restored beyond recognition . Mr. Lloyd George assured the 33


### Column 1

CAUSE . 491 House that the Ancient Monuments Bill now under considera- tion of a joint committee of both Houses might be so amended as to enable the Office of Works and its official inspector to deal with imperilled monuments as cases arise ; and also that he would be prepared to consider any proposal that may be made for adding to the expert investigation staff employed by the English Commission . He meant we hope , the British Commis- sion . It seems rather a poor state of things that the richest country in the world cannot afford to keep going a staff capable of overtaking the necessary labours within a score of years . The Policeman and the Motor - Car . " Parliamentary duty has its alleviations . It must surely have compensated for several hours of boredom to hear Lord Ninian Crichton - Stuart solemnly enquiring of the Home Secretary whether it was the duty of a police constable to stop motor - cars ' whose drivers are breaking the law by either furious driving , or driving to the danger of the public , " and whether , if so , instructions might be given " that all cars are to be stopped at the time of the commitment of the offence . " With equal solemnity , Mr. McKenna replied that when an offence of this kind was committed " in view of a constable , " it was that con- stable's duty " to intervene and stop the car , if practicable , or failing that to take the number , if he can . " " In most cases , however , " remarked Mr. McKenna , a constable , being on the footway , would not be able to stop a car which passes at a furious pace . We would suggest to any ingenious member of Parliament that there is now an excellent opening to suggest that police constables should be armed with " non - kill " pistols , weapons much favoured by householders in lonely districts , which upon the pulling of the trigger emit fumes that render the person under whose nose they are discharged giddy , con- fused , and , for a minute or two , almost unconscious . interval the constable might triumphantly perform his duty of intervention . " << A Young Woman and a Bulldog . In that In Manchester last week a constable , who was pursuing a man suspected of stealing poultry , found himself late at night in the centre of a hostile crowd . A young woman , who was acting as cloak - room attendant at a hall where a ball was going on , intervened with a bulldog on a leash , and told the policeman that if he would hold his prisoner she and her dog would hold the crowd - an offer which she successfully carried out . Women whose duties oblige them to be out late in solitary or ill - famed thoroughfares might save themselves from a little occasional danger , and from a good deal of constant nervous tension , by following her example . The Feminist Windmill . A good deal of confused thinking might surely become clari- fied if people were but better trained in a knowledge of the precise value of words . Father Day , of the Society of Jesus , speaking recently at Manchester , and tilting at a windmill to which he gave the name of " Feminism , " spent a great deal of eloquence in denouncing an " equality between men and women , " the assertion of which is nothing short of a lie and a blasphemy . It contradicts reason and flaunts in the face of Providence . " Yet in the next breath he declared that which sex was superior and which inferior was a matter of opinion― a statement which on the face of it appears to posit equality between them . What Father Day was so greatly disturbed about was not equality at all , but identity , as , indeed , he plainly showed when he talked about " an equality which converts a woman into a man . " The equality which is really desired by a great many reasonable and highly respectable people of both sexes is equality of opportunity ; and it is a very odd thing that those persons who are quite sure that women are fundamentally and essentially inferior are the very people who are so dreadfully afraid of allowing to women any equality of opportunity . Surely if women are so inferior the most un- answerable way of proving their inferiority is to allow them every opportunity of competing upon equal terms . Every Modern Requirement . We should From a contemporary advertisement we extract the following surprising passage : - W. C. ( Bloomsbury ) .... Small bedroom in basement , 5s . Every modern requirement . " have supposed that there were several important modern requirements in the way of health that were quite incompatible with residence in a " small bedroom in basement . " .

492 THE COMMON MANHOOD Suffrage Labour will Women ( By kind permission of the Artists ' Suffrage League . ) THE LABOUR PARTY'S It is an open secret that negotiations are in hand between the Labour Party and the Government , and between the Labour Party and the onalists . To please the Irish the Labour Party voted for the establishment of the Irish Second Chamber , and decided to support the industrial clauses of the Home Rule Bill . By so doing they have put the Irish Party under an It is rumoured at the time of printing obligation to them . that a compromise has been agreed upon between the Labour Party and the Government with regard to the amending of the Trades Unions Bill . All these transactions have afforded means of putting pressure on those who wish to obstruct the passage of a Women's Suffrage measure , and we may be sure our friends have not neglected their opportunity . Mr. Ramsay MacDonald has assured that he and his party are doing " all that can be done " for our cause in the House of Commons . It would be a mistake to set our hearts on this or that means of gaining our end , and to lose sight of the end itself . The methods of Parliamentary diplomacy are not always simple and obvious to the outsider . But Mr. MacDonald is one of the ablest Parliamentarians in the House , and he has behind him a party pledged to secure the inclusion of women in the Reform Bill . Those who dislike and fear our present election policy are endeavouring to persuade us that our confidence in the Labour Party is misplaced , and to make their words true by alienating the less strong Suffragists among them . The latter task is made easier by the recent development in the policy of the W.S.P.U. , who have chosen for their first point of attack the constituencies of Mr. Philip Snowden and Mr. Henderson - two of our best friends in the House of Commons . But the Labour Party has set a good example to the Govern- ment and to our weak - kneed supporters in the House of Com- mons by the way in which they have met this attack . They declare that they are not going to be turned aside from their support of a cause they admit to be just by militancy or any- thing else . The report in the papers to the effect that the Labour Party's Conference on October 15th had decided not to oppose the third reading of the Reform Bill if women were excluded was one of the many mis - statements made by those to whose interest it is to make them . The resolution passed at that conference declared that the policy of the Parliamentary Labour Party would be to carry out the resolutions adopted at their annual Conference at Birmingham last January . We all know that one of those resolutions declared that " no Bill

One thing may be taken as certain , the Labour Party will not consent to any arrangement with the Government or with the Irish Party which would place any restriction on their freedom to fight by - elections . Spying Out the Land . In addition to the campaigns already undertaken in Lan- cashire , Yorkshire , Northumberland and Scotland , Miss Mar- garet Robertson , the Election Fighting Fund organiser , is making a tour of constituencies at present held by Labour Members , or where there is likely to be a three - cornered contest at the next election . Last week she visited Nuneaton and Accrington . This week she goes to Ilkeston , Rotherham , and the North - Eastern Federation . Rotherham . The E.F.F. Committee is sending a special organiser to Rotherham for a fortnight , to follow up Miss Robertson's work . It is felt that the constituency of Mr. Pease , the Anti - Suffrage Cabinet Minister in charge of the Manhood Suffrage Bill , is particularly worthy of attention , and the prospects of a suc- cessful campaign there are very bright . C Crewe . The E.F.F. Committee has also decided to support Mr. Holmes if he stands again for the Crewe Division . Mr. Holmes is a whole - hogger " for Women's Suffrage , a thoroughly staunch and reliable friend . He is well - known and liked in Crewe , and the successful campaign carried out there by the allied forces of Labour and Women's Suffrage at the by - election of three months ago gave both Labour and Women's Suffrage a firm footing in the constituency . There are several kinds of help the Suffragists can give to Mr. Holmes which will be valuable to him if he contests the seat again , as we hope he will . Corrections .

OCTOBER 24 , 1912 . THE COMMON The Will of the Many . Votes for Women contained last week the following state- ment : - At the first re - union of the leaders after the enforced holiday , Mrs. Pankhurst and Miss Christabel Pankhurst outlined a new militant policy which Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence found themselves altogether unable to approve . Mrs. Pankhurst and Miss Christabel Pankhurst indicated that they were not prepared to modify their intentions , and recommended that Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence should resume absolute control of the paper , Votes for Women , and should leave the Women's Social and Political Union . Rather than make schism in the ranks of the Union , Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence consented to take this course . In these circumstances Mr. and Mrs. Pethick Lawrence will not be present at the Royal Albert Hall meeting on October 17th . It was further explained that the paper would be continued by Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence , who declared in it that they had no intention of forming a separate party , and that a new organ , The Suffragette , would represent the views of the Women's Social and Political Union , and would be edited by Miss Chris- tabel Pankhurst . Careful comparison of the two periodicals fails to reveal the precise cause of difference between the groups . Each sings the praise of militancy ; but The Suffragette is de- cidedly the more bellicose , and makes plain an intention - pro- claimed with equal clearness at the Albert Hall meeting on Thursday last to oppose Labour candidates at elections , no less than Liberal candidates . In other words , the Women's Social and Political Union , under the command of Mrs. Pankhurst , intend to be present in the constituencies of future by - elections , and to preach an opposition policy to that of the National Union of Suffrage Societies . This course would be confusing to the less instructed among the electors , and unpleasant for our organisers , who have no wish to carry on a campaign of opposition to any other group of Suffragists ; but it will at least have the advan- tage of showing those electors who object to militancy that we really are a completely different set of people from those who practise it . While the W.S.P.U. is engaged in denouncing us and our ways , we shall be saved the trouble of explaining over and over again that we are not the W.S.P. U. , and that we do not agree with their methods or their policy . We shall , it is earnestly to be hoped , avoid recrimination , and do our best to carry on our work undisturbed by any that may be addressed to us . The split , in itself , is not without its moral for constitutional suffragists , and inevitably suggests a comparison between the situation of a society governed autocratically and one framed upon the democratic model which has been slowly evolved by experience , and of which the general pattern may be studied in The Chairman's Handbook . 4 A highly centralised body is nimbler , easier to wield , to deploy , and to advertise ; it has more real rapidity of action , and a semblance of greater efficiency . In skilful hands such a body may easily be made to appear both more numerous and more united than it really is . For purposes of political display these are unquestionable advantages ; and in a conflict that can be won in a spurt , a dictatorship is not to be despised . But autocratic government is unstable , partly because the will and judgment of any one person , or the wills and judgments of any small junta of persons , are liable to error , to change , and to warping , and partly because the rank and file , being excluded from a voice in the government , are liable to disagreement and disaffection which , having no channel of proper expression , may undermine the whole edifice unawares , so that it goes suddenly to pieces . Therefore , autocracy is unfit for a movement that has to make a long , uphill fight . On the other hand , a body in which the leaders are elected by their constituents , and bound by resolutions passed at confer- ences of such constituents , must move somewhat slowly in such matters as changes of policy . It is debarred from sudden voltes - face , and from apparent outbursts of uncontrollable feel- ing . No tide of emotion in a single breast , or in half a dozen breasts , can sweep such a body out of its course . Nor can the leaders remain aloof , or unaware of what the rank and file are thinking and saying . The very condition of retaining their leadership is that they should constantly explain their opinions and acts , and constantly undergo the criticism of their con- stituents , even when this criticism takes the form - as it some- times does - of complaining that the leaders do not achieve that showy effect of compact efficiency in which a really representa- tive body will always fall behind a body which represents the will of one person . But in stability and dignity , as well as in educational value , how far superior is the position of the representative body ! In its ranks ( as in those of all live associations ) differences must occur , and members must now and again secede . But when


### Column 1

CAUSE . 493 these contingencies arise , everybody knows their why and where- fore ; the matter in debate is actually and openly debated , and the persons who remain in office are those whom the majority of the electorate , with full knowledge of the facts , chooses to appoint . In such a confederation as the National Union of Suffrage Societies , members thus , in the course of managing their own business , become acquainted with the ordinary forms of public debate , and are brought into contact with all sorts of political questions . In short , they acquire a training in the rights and duties of citizenship in the course of their endeavour to obtain them . << The Right of Married Women to Maintenance . " I have sometimes wondered at the frequency with which speakcrs from Women's Suffrage platforms refer to compara- tively trivial instances of the law's injustice to women - such instances , for example , as the refusal to accept the mother as a conscientious objector " to the child's vaccination , while the great outstanding wrong of the law's treatment of wives and widows is too often passed over in silence . Conscientious objectors to vaccination , of either sex , are not a numerous class , fortunately perhaps for the health of the community ; but the number of married women and their children and of widows and their children who are suffering privation and indignity with the practical connivance or the express sanction of the law must run to some hundreds of thousands , and the con- sequent injury to the health and happiness of the individuals concerned , and to the stamina of the population as a whole , cannot be measured in figures . The position of widows under the law is not my topic at present , though it perhaps illustrates better than any other the divergence that sometimes exists between popular sentiment and popular practice , the class which is by common consent the most entitled to pity and protection being , in fact , the most harshly treated . We have had a good deal of discussion in the " silly columns of the papers lately as to the " obey " clause in the Anglican marriage service : whether wives should or shouldn't promise to obey their husbands , and whether a good wife does , in fact , hold herself bound to obedience , and so forth . I wish some one would get up a counter discussion upon the clause by which the husband vows to endow his wife with all his worldly goods . Whatever may be the case with the obedience clause , it is obvious that the endowment clause is a dead letter in a large proportion of homes . Whether the pro- portion amounts to a majority , and , if so , how large , I do not venture to say . But I am under the impression that in the well- to - do classes , even among the happily married among those classes , the prevailing practice is not for the husband to admit the wife to a common ownership in his property or income , but for him to assign to her a definite allowance for housekeeping and , if she has no money of her own , for her dress and personal expenses ; while it is not uncommon for husbands to refuse to do even this , and to retain so close a hold upon the purse strings that they pay every bill and sign every cheque , and dole out pocket - money to their wives as they do to their school - boys and school - girls . In the best type of working - class homes , there is often a much closer approach to a genuine community of goods . Not infre- quently the wife administers the whole income , the husband and the wage - earning children , if there are any , turning out their pockets into " Mother's " lap on pay - day , and she hand- ing back to them as pocket - money as much as she thinks she can spare . But these homes are outnumbered by those where the husband " allows as of grace so much to his wife , and keeps the rest to himself , sometimes guarding jealously from her the amount of his actual earnings . Every C.O.S. visitor is familiar with the apologetic , " I don't know what he earns , I'm sure , ma'am ; I only know what he gives me , " with which her enquiries as to the family income are often met . Whatever may be the practice in various grades of society , it is certain that the law does nothing to enforce upon husbands the fulfilment of that particular marriage vow . Her husband is indeed in theory bound to maintain his wife , the obligation being implied in the fact that wilful neglect to provide for her is in certain cases a sufficient ground for a separation order , and also in the fact that if he does not supply her with necessaries , she is presumed to have his authority to pledge his credit to obtain them , unless he has taken certain steps to guard against it . or is guilty of misconduct justifying her in leaving him ) , he Further , in certain cases ( e.g. , where the husband has deserted , cannot revoke her right to pledge his credit for necessaries .

494 THE COMMON This right , however , is in most cases , of practically no use to a working woman , since she can rarely obtain credit , except in shops where she is well known , and these are not at all likely to give her credit if they know or suspect that the husband will refuse to pay up . There is no way of obliging a husband to give his wife any portion of his wages or anything whatever towards the maintenance of the home so long as they remain together . He may , and as every worker among the poor knows , in an appall- ingly large number of cases he actually does , spend the whole , or a monstrously large part , of what he earns upon himself , upon drink , tobacco , betting and his other menus plaisirs , leaving the wife to keep the home together , and even to provide such of his own meals as he takes at home out of her own scanty earnings and those of the children . If this state of things becomes unen- durable , her only remedy is to break up the home altogether . She can throw herself and her children into the Workhouse , and the Guardians then may ( or at their discretion may not ) recover the cost of their maintenance from the husband . Or , she may apply to a magistrate for a separation order , on the ground of his failure to maintain her ; but she will have to prove that the neglect has been so bad that it has caused her to leave him . This is one of the grounds for such orders , the others being aggravated assault , persistent cruelty , habitual drunkenness and desertion . If the separation order is granted , it is usually , if the wife has no means of her own , accompanied by an order to the husband to pay a certain sum weekly to his wife . But the means for enforcing this order are so preposterously ineffective that , in a large proportion of cases , it is a dead letter . The order cannot be made a charge upon the husband's wages , and obtained from his employer , although obviously that would be the only safe way of ensuring payment , and would , besides , exercise a wholesomely deterrent effect upon husbands , who dislike , above all things , anything that shows up their delinquencies to their employers or their mates . The onus is put upon the wife of obtaining the money , and if four weeks have elapsed since the order was made , the wife may obtain another summons , for which she may be obliged to pay another 3s . But as the only result of her action will be to get her husband sent to gaol , her good feeling , her bodily fear of his vengeance , and her know- ledge that his imprisonment must suspend his earning power , and possibly lead to his permanent loss of employment , all com- bine to prevent her attempting this means of obtaining her rights . The amount of the maintenance orders granted by magistrates is another point in which the bias of the law , or , at least , of its interpreters , in favour of the man as against the woman , shows itself very plainly . The amount may be fixed at the discretion of the magistrate at any sum up to £ 2 . As a matter of fact , the sum usually granted for the maintenance of the wife and children in Liverpool ( and I have been told that magistrates elsewhere are no more liberal ) , is usually about one - third of the man's wages , perhaps slightly more if there are many children . There are many , many men who are not sorry to find them- selves discharged by the law from all responsibility for their families at so low a figure . A scavenger , for example , of my acquaintance , has a regular income of 24s . a week . By per- sistent and long - drawn - out cruelty and neglect , the details of which were fully given in court , he forced his wife with her five children to apply for separation . The court inflicted no penalty , but ordered him to pay 8s . a week . This he does occasionally , living in comfort himself at a quasi - philanthropic lodging - house on the remaining 16s . , retaining the 8s . whenever he has some extra need . The evil effect on public opinion of thus stereotyping and giving official sanction to the view that a man is doing all that is expected of him if he spends a third of his wage on his wife and family , and two - thirds on himself , is a point that does not seem to occur to magistrates . Perhaps they think that a woman and three or four or five children are only worth the third of a man . " An enormous and increasing number of men take advantage of the broad and easy path thus open to them by deserting their wives without waiting for them to take the initiative of applying for separation . The maxim that " The law is a Hass is perhaps better illustrated by its behaviour with regard to the offence of wife desertion than by any other matter . It really seems as though the object was to smooth away every difficulty from the path of the deserter . First , to constitute desertion , there must be proof of an inten- tion on the husband's part to break off matrimonial relations . As in the majority of cases the husband simply absconds , with- out leaving any information , it is usually impossible for the wife to satisfy the Court that he has deserted , unless his absence has lasted for some weeks , at any rate . Even after she has taken out a summons , it is frequently a fortnight before it is heard .


### Column 1

CAUSE . OCTOBER 24 , 1912 This , of course , gives the husband ample time to disappear . If he does disappear , in the vast majority of cases no effort is made to find him , unless by the Guardians , if the wife has become chargeable . Most Boards of Guardians refuse out - relief to deserted wives , for fear of collusive desertions , and most charit- able societies refuse help , too , for the same reason , so , unless the wife goes , into the Workhouse , she gets no help anywhere . If the man goes abroad , or to one of the colonies , he cannot be extradited under any law . He may be known to be living in comfort at a given address in New York or Canada , while his wife and children are starving over here , but he cannot be touched . But , indeed , he need not trouble himself to go so far . If he goes to a neighbouring city , or even to another part of the same city , the chances are heavily against anyone's troubling to hunt him up . There may be a warrant out against him , but unless the wife can say exactly where he is to be found , or unless the warrant officer is a more energetic individual than usual , very little trouble is taken to trace him . out . " A few days ago I asked a very experienced officer of the S.P.C.C. to tell me how , in his opinion , the law with regard to maintenance orders in separation and desertion cases worked He broke in upon my question with the curt verdict : " It works out as badly as possible , and nothing could be worse . We can only , I think , pronounce the same verdict upon the whole question of the attitude of the law towards the right of married women to maintenance . The truth is that those who have made the law , and those who administer it , are actuated as a rule , by a spirit of deep respect for the rights of property , and for the rights of husbands . Their feeling on both points has made them jealously guard against anything that might interfere in any way with what they consider " a man's un- doubted right to spend his own money as he pleases . " Any concessions made to wives that infringe to any degree upon this sacred axiom , have been granted in as meagre and ineffective a form , and are administered as grudgingly as possible . What women have to do is to strive for the recognition of the principle that when a man marries he enters into an implicit contract to maintain his wife and his children , and that since that is so , she and they have a claim upon his wages or other income which the law is bound effectively to enforce . Her claim becomes the stronger when it is realised that it is mainly owing to the assumption that men have wives and families to keep , that they are paid wages which are about double those paid to women doing the same or equivalent work . It is through the automatic economic influence upon the rate of wages of a standard of living based upon the requirements of a family that the com- munity provides for the cost of its own renewal . A man , there- fore , who refuses to maintain his family is violating his trustee- ship . It is important that this should be clearly understood , because experience shows that to express a right in terms of property is by far the most effective way of bringing it home to the conscience of the average modern Briton . Our forefathers suffered and bled for the rights of conscience , of free speech and of self - government . But the men of to - day have enjoyed these rights so long that they have forgotten what it feels like to be without them , and rights of property are now the only rights of others for which most of them apparently care a brass farthing . Women and the Home Rule Bill . MR . SNOWDEN'S AMENDMENT . Clause 9 of the Home Rule Bill will come before the House of Commons on Monday , November 4th . That is the clause which determines who shall be the electors for the Irish Par- liament . The clause as it stands enacts that , the electors for the Irish Parliament shall be the same for the Imperial Parlia- ment , but two amendments have been put down which would give a share of representation to women . The first of these , moved by Mr. Crawshay Williams , would establish Adult Suffrage for men and women on a three months ' residential qualification , with a higher age for women than for men , and would also introduce the transferable vote . This proposal is not calculated to commend itself to Conservatives , and as it is well known that , failing a Government measure , no Women's Suffrage amendment can pass which does not rally the support of Suffragists of all parties , we may discuss Mr. Crawshay Williams ' proposal as impracticable . Apart from the fact it would have of arousing Conservative opposition , it would introduce complications into the Home Rule Bill which might plausibly be considered by the Irish to endanger its passage , and would be opposed by them on that ground . It is quite a different matter , however , with the amendment to be moved by Mr. Philip Snowden on behalf of the Concilia- tion Committee . This amendment would make the electorate



## Page 6

OCTOBER 24 , 1912 . THE for the Irish Parliament the same as the present Irish Local Government electorate , which includes women . This would not introduce the contentious proposals involved in Mr. Crawshay- Williams ' amendment ; it would not introduce a new register , but would take the register already working with success in Irish Local Government . It is a simple , logical proposal , which ought to enlist the support of every member of the House of Commons who admits the claim of women to any representation at all . It ought even to secure the support of many an Anti- Suffragist , because the Anti - Suffrage League itself proclaims as one of its objects the extension of women's sphere in the Local Government . A great many of Anti - Suffragists have always told us that they would be quite willing to give women a voice in domestic legislature so long as they did not interfere in Imperial politics . Now the Irish Parliament will not have to deal wth Imperial politics at all . It will be concerned solely with the home politics of Ireland , and Anti - Suffragists ought , according to the tenets of their own League , to be in favour of giving women a voice in these matters . Evidence is coming in daily that this point of view does appeal to them . Indeed , it is hard to see where opposition will come from . Mr. Harold Baker himself , who moved the rejection of the Con- ciliation Bill last March , said on that occasion that if we had separate Parliaments for the separate nations of the United Kingdom the question of Women's Suffrage would take on a different aspect . The same thing has constantly been said to us by members in the course of interviews and deputations . Mr. Churchill , when he put forward his suggestions for a scheme of Home Rule all round , made a point of the fact that those local Parliaments would afford a wide scope for women's activities . Lord Haldane , in a speech delivered at Aberdeen in October of last year , said : " Suppose devolution takes place ; suppose Imperial affairs are left to the Imperial Parliament , and local matters affecting Scotland , England and Wales are to be left to local Parliaments , are you to exclude women from these local Parliaments , which are not concerned with the Imperial Army and Navy ? Are you to shut out women from these Parliaments ? You cannot do it consistently after what you have done about local Government and education . " Mr. Asquith has stated that the Home Rule Bill is but the first step in a Federal scheme . The constitution of the Irish Parliament , and its electorate , will inevitably be taken as a precedent for similar Parliaments to be established later in England and Scotland and Wales . It is , therefore , of the very first importance , not only to Irish women , but to the Suffrage movement as a whole , that the claims of women to representation shall not be ignored in the Home Rule Bill . To set up a new " representative " body at this hour of the day which left women entirely unrepresented would be a grave injustice and a wanton insult to women of which we cannot believe the House of Commons will be guilty . There are the highest prospects of success for Mr. Snowden's amendment , and suffragists must concentrate all their energies in showing that it has widespread support in the country . * The amendment is neither a wrecking amendment nor a Parliamentary amendment , but is moved on behalf of the Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage , which includes members of all parties . Liberals must support it if they ever want to make speeches about representative Government again . Conservatives can support it without in any way committing themselves to the Home Rule Bill as a whole . The Labour Party are pledged to Women's Suffrage and should support it solidly . The large majority of Irish members are Suffragists and will , we hope , take this opportunity of wiping out the stain which rests upon their party for having defeated the Conciliation Bill . They surely will not vote against the enfranchisement of their own fellow - country women , for their own national Parliament .

COMMON CAUSE . In Parliament . 495 REFORM BILL OR PLURAL VOTING . On Wednesday , October 16th , Mr. Snowden asked whether the Government still intended to proceed with the Franchise and Registration Bill through all its stages in the present session , or to drop it and substitute a measure for the abolition of plural voting . The question arose , of course , out of an expression used by the Chief Government Whip ( Mr. Acland ) , who has explained that it was not meant in any way to imply an intention on the Government's part of dropping the so - called Reform Bill . Mr. Lloyd George answered to the same effect . matter . UNPAID OVERTIME . On the same day Mr. Snowden also asked whether any com- munication had been received from the women clerks employed on the unemployment insurance work , protesting against the low rate of pay for extra duty awarded them in respect of over- time worked by them in connection with the National Insurance Act in July last , and , if so , what Mr. Buxton was doing in the Mr. Buxton had received the communication ; but pointed out that it is " specifically laid down in the terms of appointment of Labour Exchange officials that no payment for overtime will be made . ' He added that it was , however , pro- posed to grant gratuities to officers in respect of overtime work performed during June and July out of a lump sum specially sanctioned for the purpose . " It is earnestly to be hoped that the matter will not be allowed to rest here . The question why a Government Department pro- posed not to pay for some of the work done for it , ought to be pressed , and to obtain an answer . EQUAL PAY . " 7 An important question was asked by Mr. Frederick Whyte about the payment of officials employed under the National Insurance Act ; he wished to know whether ( a ) the remuneration for men and women is the same in the highest and lowest grades , ( b ) whether , in the intervening grades , the remunera- tion is " fixed on two separate bases , one , the higher , for men , and another , the lower , for women . He further desired to hear the reason for this difference of treatment . Mr. Master- man replied that the salaries paid to women on the Insurance Commission staff were ( except in the case of health insurance officers , whose scale of salary is from £ 80 to £ 150 per annum ) rather lower than those paid to the next nearly corresponding grades of male officers . " Assistant inspectors enter at the same minimum of £ 100 or ( in the case of specially experienced can- didate ) £ 200 , " but the women proceed to a somewhat lower maximum salary . " The differentiation of salaries he attributed partly to the fact tht the duties of the male and female staff were on the whole not identical ; and partly to " the normal practice in the public service , which is now under consideration by a Royal Commission . << All Suffragists are invited to watch for the report of this com- mission , and to buy it immediately it appears . LLANY STUMDWY . There seems at last a probability that some at least of the wretches who so disgracefully ill - treated the militant Suffragists in Wales will be brought to book . Mr. McKenna , who last week seemed to hold out little hope of an arrest , told the House on Monday , in answer to questions , that the local chief constable had now obtained evidence of two cases of assault , and that proceedings were likely to be taken . How far this comparative success of the chief constable , after so long an interval of total failure to secure any evidence may have been assisted by the pertinacity with which questions have been pressed in Parlia- ment it would perhaps be unkind to inquire .

Our movement has once more reached a critical stage in its history , and Suffragists are called upon once again to show that their energy and enthusiasm are unbounded . Every available seat in the Hall should be filled on November 5th , and the amount of the collection must show that delay can only stimulate members of the National Union to greater efforts There can , indeed , never have been a time when Suffragists have felt more determined . The Government has ventured to introduce what is practically a manhood suffrage bill ; we have resolved , either that women must be included in the Bill , or that the Bill must not become law - 1884 is not to be repeated in 1913. There must be no further extension of the franchise to men unless it is accompanied by a measure of enfranchisement for women . This is our answer to the Government , and we must enforce it on November 5th by a great demonstration , both in numbers and in funds . We have to show that our Election Fighting Fund is formidable , and that we can raise a large sum RELIABLE FURS We have always in stock a wonder- ful variety of fashionable Fur Coats , of which the garment illustrated is a typical example .

The Daily Citizen treats as ridiculous the declaration of the policy of opposing Labour recently made by Mrs. Pankhurst and the section of militant Suffragists who follow her . Mr. Ramsay Macdonald , in a letter of some length , addressed to the Women's Labour League , states that " it will turn the Labour Party neither to the right hand nor to the left in its efforts to get women included in the Reform Bill . " In the same letter he makes the strange omission of any reference to the work of Constitutional Suffragists , and his statement that " it is not men who have stood in the way of the enfranchisement of women , but a small section of the women themselves , " is a proposition which Suffragists keenly criticise , no matter how strongly they con- demn the policy of the militants in the past . That this section to which he refers is so small , is obviously , in itself , one refuta- tion of the suggestion that the militants and not Members of Parliament are wholly responsible for recent failure to enfran- chise women . The leader on the same day emphatically states that- " The Labour members will fight hard to secure the enfranchisement of women . No member of the party will desert or betray the women's cause , but their task is likely to be made doubly hard by tactics which are deplorably short - sighted and disastrous . A few of the women seem to have reached a point where reason and judgment are to be dethroned , and other considerations are to weigh more heavily with them than the cause they set out to achieve . In the midst of all this fury the Labour Party will not swerve from its purpose . " The Independent Labour Party , in its leader this week , states as clearly as it is possible to do , the line which they consider it is the business of the Labour Members in Parliament to take with regard to the Reform Bill . " The Labour Members in Parliament have been fully instructed by the Labour Party Conference and the I.L.P. conference concerning the general opinion and wish of the rank and file of these organisations in the matter of the women's franchise . They have been told that the whole movement is in accord in demanding the complete enfranchisement of both men and women , and that , so far as the majority of the I abour Party conference , and the unanimous voice of the I.L.P. conference are concerned , no Bill that does not include women's enfranchisement is to receive their support . The opinion and will of these conferences stand supreme over all branch resolutions whatsoever . Unless that is so , the

Miss Rathbone put forward the claims of women for the vote very forcibly and ended by asking Lord Helmsley if he did not feel able to refrain from voting against the amendments to include women in the Reform Bill . In Lord Helmsley's reply , he gave many reasons for his opposition to Women's Suffrage , and clearly told the deputation that his prin- ciples were unalterably opposed to the granting of Parliamentary votes to women . Miss Rathbone then asked him whether , as he had referred to the work which women could do in local government , he would not at least , support the amendment to the Reform Bill extending voting privileges to women at local elections . Lord Helmsley indicated that he thought it was reasonable that married women should have the same privileges as other women in this matter , and without pledging himself , he said ' he would favourably consider the matter when it came up in the House .

Two ladies come from Weston - super - Mare specially to attend , and , although outsiders are rigorously excluded , we have reason to hope that our Society will gain some really good speakers from this class . on On September 24th Miss Agnes Tanner read a paper " Josephine Butler " to the Co - operative women at Totterdown , and on September 29th Mrs. Martin gave a Suffrage address at Oakfield Road Chapel . This meeting was presided over by the Minister , the Rev. Dr. Beckh , who became a member of our Society . This week we are having a Cake and Sweet Sale with Musical Teas at Drayton , Beaufort Road , by kind permission of Mrs. W. C. Cross . Contributions for the stalls are coming in and we are hoping for a much needed addition to the sinews of war . EAST BRISTOL . - The work under its special committee is steadily going forward . The women of the district are being systematically canvassed and a great deal of ground is thus being broken . Women's meetings have been started on alternate Tuesdays at 3 o'clock , speech with tea and discussion to follow ; while on alternate Wednesdays we have meetings at 8 p.m. for men and women with coffee and discussion to follow .

" The meeting was held by invitation at the Life - boat Restaurant , Dr. Clifford Last kindly taking the chair . Between forty and fifty people were present , a large sprinkling being teachers in private and board schools . The resolution , " That this meeting is of opinion that no further extension of the franchise can be satisfactory until the claims of women are included in its provisions , " was carried unanimously . CHELTENHAM . - Miss Bathurst , who has been making a tour in the west , held a very successful meeting here on September 27th . A good many sympathisers outside the ranks of the teaching profession were present and were deeply interested in the entirely new point of view put before them - i.e . , the necessity of women's direct influence on elementary education .

On June 26th a garden meeting was held at Mrs. Grubb's when Miss Blackstone , of Bath , gave an address on the new policy of the N.U. and on the " Friends " of Suffrage scheme . A new member , Mr. Burn , made a very sympathetic speech , and the meeting was well attended . The chief financial event of the year took place on September 25th . A small but energetic committee again worked up a sale which was held at Mrs. Lean's as before . Cake , sweets , garden produce and other useful articles disappeared rapidly , and at the end of the afternoon nothing was left and £ 16 168. had been realised . This will serve to finance the winter's work . The annual meeting was held on October 16th . The report showed that the branch had made great pro- gress , there being 60 members , as compared with 35 last year , and large public meetings having been held , in addition to drawing - room meetings . The public gatherings were addressed by Miss Helen Fraser and Miss Royden respectively . The five drawing - room meetings held have been fairly well attended , and Mrs. Maltby ( member of committee ) has begun to organise the " Friends " of Suffrage scheme . West Lancs . , West Cheshire and North Wales . The LIVERPOOL Society held a successful members ' meeting on October 11th , Mrs. E. Stewart Brown was in the chair , and Mrs. Corbett Ashby , the speaker , gave a most interesting and stirring speech on Reform Bill , Married Women's Enfranchisement , and chiefly on the great necessity for every member to give all the time , money and personal help she possibly could for the next three months . une Miss C. Leadley Brown and Miss E. Deakin , who respectively proposed and seconded the vote of thanks to the speaker , reminded the audience of the office which is about to be opened and of the " postcard rallies " which the Society was organising the next week . Two very successful open - air meetings were held in Mr. Houstin's constituency on October 15th and 17th and a number of postcards were signed by the audiences . On the afternoons of the 14th , 15th and 16th postcard rallies were organised , members visiting streets in couples and returning for tea and to compare notes . The office will not be available until the end of November , but in the meantime the Society has arranged for temporary accommodation . The WALLASEY AND WIRRAL Society held its annual meeting on September 26th with Miss Eskrigge in the chair . It was regretfully announced that Miss McPherson , the Hon .

Leadley Brown was the speaker , and arrangements are now being made for a series of open - air meetings in the town and neigh- bourhood . Eastern Counties . ORGANISERS . - Miss Coyle spent September in N. NORFOLK , and has arranged several public meetings which are to be held in the district during November . The Fakenham Society has affiliated to the N.U. Miss Coyle is now giving her time to the getting up of memorials . a Miss Farnell is doing the same work in HUNTS . Nearly 100 signatures have been obtained for memorial to Mr. Cator , and one to Mr. Locker - Lampson is now in hand . The latter , after receiving a deputa- tion in July , consented to be again approached on the subject in the autumn . Mrs. Streeter has been working with Miss Coyle in N. Norfolk , and afterwards for a few days in Thetford . On October 16th and 17th the Lady Frances Balfour addressed meetings at Felixstowe , Dovercourt , Thetford and Huntingdon , Miss Eva Ward being second speaker in each case . All four meetings were successful . Detailed accounts having not yet come in ; these will be included in our next report . Mrs. Kellett and Miss Creak both attended the National Union Council meetings in Manchester . Mrs. Streeter and Miss Coyle were also there , and the occasion proved to be most useful for the interchange of news and the arrangement of future work . NORWICH . - During the past month a garden meeting , especially for servants , was given by Miss E. Willis . Mary Bell spoke and several new members were enrolled . On August 3rd Norwich suffragists had the oppor- tunity of hearing Miss Abadam speak at a meeting organised by the Catholic Suffrage Society on occasion of the Catholic Conference in Norwich . Dr. the A deputation waited on Mr. G. H. Roberts ( Labour ) , on August 12th , to find out what amendments to the Reform Bill he would be prepared to support . Mr. Roberts said that failing the adult suffrage amendment he would be prepared to support the Dickinson amend- ment , but not the Conciliation amendment . Nor would

THE COMMON CAUSE , he advocate voting against the third reading of the Reform Bill should women be excluded . At the same time he declared his willingness to abide by the decision of his Party in the matter . CAMBRIDGE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION . - At a general meeting of this association held at the Assembly Rooms , Green Street , on September 27th , an address was given by Miss I. B. O'Malley on the methods and aims of the " Friends of Women Suffrage " movement . She was followed by Mrs. Donald Robertson , who briefly explained the arrangements made for the carrying out of the scheme in Cambridge . A resolution was carried unanimously condemning the weakening clauses in the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and calling for their deletion . The proceedings ter- minated with a vote of thanks to Miss O'Malley for her stimulating address . N. and E. Essex Branch The annual meeting of the above society was held in the Town Hall , MALDON , on Wednesday , September 25th , and the report and balance sheet were read . The former gave a record of steady progress , increase in inembership , and an account of the various outings which have been organised throughout the district . including two very successful " At Homes , " one being held at Braintree in June , with Lady Frances Balfour and the Rev. Dr. Cohls for speakers , and the other at Earl's Colne . Reference was made to the sister societies of Dunmow , Colchester and Chelmsford , which had been visited by speakers from the N. and E. Essex branch . After the business proceedings a tea was provided and a public meeting took place presided over by Miss Courtauld , the Hon . Secretary . Mrs. Alderton , of Colchester , gave a most forceful and convincing address on the present situation , appealing to all to do their utmost to secure the success of the cause in the coming Reform Bill , and bringing home to the audience the terrible wrong and injustice which would take place if the franchise should be further extended to men without any women being included . was HELIXSTOWE . - Lady Frances Balfour was the principal speaker at a meeting held at Felixstowe on October 16th under the auspices of the local branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies . Mrs : W. T. Griffiths took the chair , and spoke of the legal subordination of one sex to another , which was harmful and hindered reform . Lady Frances in an interesting address stated that women were asking to be treated as free citizens in a free land , and that as women were essentially home makers and keepers it very necessary that they should have a voice in legis- lation which directly or indirectly affected the home . She moved the resolution : - " That this meeting , while deprecating all methods of violence in political agita- tion , believes that the enfranchisement of duly qualified women is a measure of justice long overdue and calls upon Captain Peel to do all in his power to secure some measure of Women's Suffrage in the Reform Bill and to oppose any further extension of the franchise to men which leaves women unrepresented . " This was seconded by Mr. Evan Edwards and carried without dissent . Miss Eva Ward spoke of the position of women in Ireland and proposed a resolution : " That this meeting , while deprecating all methods of violence in political agitation , believes that the legitimate and constitutional demand for the enfranchisement of women should be conceded , and calls upon Captain Peel to support Mr. Snowden's amendment to the Home Rule Bill , which would include Irish women municipal voters in the electorate for the Irish Parliament . " Miss Place seconded this and it was carried unanimously . The meeting , which was well attended , broke up after a vote of thanks to chair and speakers , proposed by Dr. Forster and seconded by Miss Lloyd . West Riding ( Yorks ) . LEEDS . - The weekly At Homes " were resumed on Wednesday , October 2nd , when the meeting , which was well attended , took the form of a social gathering . Mrs. Renton ( organiser , West Riding Federation ) , who was to have spoken , was unavoidably prevented by ill- ness from being present . Miss I. O. Ford reviewed the political situation and outlined the nature of the autumn work . On October 9th , Miss Hayden gave a delightful address on " Ireland and Women's Suffrage . " Miss Coignon took the chair . The speaker gave an account of the position of the wife in Ireland in the 17th Century , and described the disabilities under which Catholic and Dissenter girls suffered with regard to education during the days of oppression . Touching allusion was made to the great work of Mr. and Mrs. Haslam in the cause of women . On October 9th , Mrs. Parrish addressed the Chapel- town Adult School , and on October 14th Miss I. O. Ford spoke to the Roundhay Road Women's Liberal Association . Good work has been done at the stall for sale of Women's Suffrage literature , which was taken by the Leeds Society at the Industrial Exhibition . There are still a number of 3d . tickets of admission to the Exhibition to be had at the office , 9 , Park Lane ( between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. ) , and members are now at liberty to purchase any number of those remaining . The Exhibition closes November 2nd . It is hoped that every member will attend and bring as many friends as possible to the lecture in the Town Hall by Miss Ellen Terry on Thursday , October 24th , on the " Triumphant Heroines of Shakespeare . " HUDDERSFIELD . - A largely attended meeting has been held , at which Miss I. O. Ford , of Leeds , was chief speaker and moved the usual resolution . Mrs Josiah Lockwood seconded , and gave a report of the Manchester meeting . The resolution was carried with enthusiasm . Six delegates from Huddersfield were present at the Council in Manchester . Mrs. Glaisyer , one of our members , is standing as candidate for the South Central Ward in the forth- coming municipal election , and we wish her success . BARNSLEY . - On September 16th , 17th , 18th , 19th and 20th , we had Mrs. Chew , of Rochdale . Five open - air meetings were held in Barnsley and district , and a resolution calling upon Parliament to enfranchise women this session was passed at each one . Two dissentients at Barnsley and six at Wombwell . At each meeting there was an audience of 300 or more of both men and women . Mrs. Chew's able speeches interested them greatly , and we were warmly asked to have more meet- ings . During the week ten dozen copies of the COMMON CAUSE were sold . On September 24th a meeting of members and friends was held in the Lecture Hall of the Y.M.C.A. About 80 people were present . Miss Florence Balgarnie and Miss Emily Ford gave addresses , and a resolution was passed calling for Parlia- ment to pass a women's amendment to the Reform Bill .

499 Liberal Executive to tea and to meet Miss Florence Balgarnie . There was not a large attendance , but those who were there were very enthusiastic , and each pro- mised to write letters to Sir Joseph Walton , the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer , urging a women's amendment to the Reform Bill , and promised also to have a resolution brought before their next Executive Committee meeting . On October 10th a public meeting was held in the Arcade Hall . There was a crowded audience . Mrs. Despard and Miss I. O. Ford gave most inspiring ad- dresses , and we are receiving applications for member- ship . A resolution was carried unanimously protesting against the injustice of the Government in bringing before the House a Reform Bill for men alone , and calling for the inclusion of women . Three dozen copies of the COMMON CAUSE were sold . SHEFFIELD . The first meeting of this session was held in Nether Schoolroom on October 18th , and was social in character . The chief attraction was an address on " Women's Work in Local Government , " by Miss Maude Maxfield , who is contesting the Hallam Ward as candi- date for the City Council . Dr. Helen Wilson , who presided , spoke on the political situation , and Mrs. Gill gave an interesting account of the Council meeting in Manchester , which she attended as Sheffield delegate . Mrs. H. F. Hall was hostess for the evening , and Mrs. Snaith , whom we are glad to welcome as Social Evenings Secretary , provided a delightful programme of music and recitations , besides superintending the refreshments . We are glad to announce that the Church League and the Friends ' League have decided to co - operate with us in the mass meeting to be held at the Albert Hall on December 11th , when Lord Lytton will be chief speaker , Miss Helen Sturge will speak for the Friends ' League , and Samuel Roberts , Esq . , M.P. , has consented to pre- side . The expenses of this meeting will be heavy , and we appeal to all our friends to help us by selling tickets . Kentish . SEVENOAKS . - A meeting was held in tho Kippington Parish Room on October 2nd . The Rev. Percy Thompson , Vicar of Kippington , presided , and the principal speaker was Miss Cicely Dean Corbett , B.A. , a lecturer to the National Union . The following resolu- tion was moved by the chairman : - " That this meeting is of opinion that the Reform Bill should not be passed into law without the enfranchisement of women being included in its scope , and , further , calls upon Mr. W. H. Forster , M.P. , to support the amendment , and if occasion arises , the Conciliation Bill Amendment . " Miss Corbett , in seconding the resolution , explained the attitude of the National Union towards the Labour Party . She spoke of the work of women on munici- pal bodies , and reviewed the action of the Government towards them , concluding an able address with the statement that because women's needs were larger than men's and they were the mothers of the future generation it was important that their point of view should be brought before the Government and that they should have an opportunity of using the ideas of women in their business . The resolution was carried unanimously , as was also a hearty vote of thanks to the speaker . On the evening of the same day a meeting was held in the DUNTON GREEN Schoolroom . Mr. A. Hickmott presided and the speaker was Miss Cicely Dean Corbett . The Chairman moved the following resolution : - " That this meeting calls upon the member for the division to vote for any amendments to the Reform Bill and to vote against the third reading of that Bill unless women are included in its scope . ' friends . Miss Corbett , in seconding the motion , said that women were simply asking that the democracy should be a real democracy and not a sex autocracy . The nation was composed of men and women and unless they worked together side by side it would not do . RAMSGATE . A successful " At Home " was held in the Lower Congregational Hall on October 18th and there was a large gathering of members and their Mrs. Poole gave a short but sympathetic introductory address , and Mrs. Nevile Wyatt read Mrs. Willey's address given at the Queen's Hall meeting on June 19th . Miss Sale spoke on the N.U. By - Election Policy and the Franchise Bill , and Councillor Soans , in an eloquent address , proposed the following resolution , which was seconded by Mrs. Smith and carried unanimously : - " That this meeting , holding that women are citizens , protests against their exclusion from the proposed Government Reform Bill which makes oitizen- ship the basis of the Franchise . " The meeting con- there was a large gathering of members and their friends . The autumn campaign in Kent begins with a series of meetings in the neighbourhood of DEAL which will culminate with our big meeting there on October 17th , when Lady Brassey will take the chair and Mr. Lyon Blease and Dr. Ettie Sayer will speak . On Saturday , September 21st , an open - air meeting was held at ST . MARGARET'S BAY , when Miss Dutton addressed a friendly and interested audience . This was followed up by a meeting in the Parish Hall on the following Friday when Miss Dutton took the chair and Miss Helga Gill spoke . The room was not so crowded as we could have wished , but the sympathy of the audience was undoubtedly with us , and they listened with apprecia- tion to Miss Gill's moderately expressed but convincing exposition of our case , and eagerly bought COMMON CAUSES at the close of the meeting . We were all most grateful to Miss Widlake , of Pentee , for the hospitality and help which she gave us at our every visit to St. Margaret's Bay . On the following Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday we held drawing - room meetings . Unfortunately , Monday's tempestuous weather prevented many friends from attend- ing the meeting which Miss Gertrude Harraden and Miss Winter so kindly arranged for us in Miss Harraden's bungalow at Kingsdown , but among the devoted few who did appear we secured several new members and a general expression of sympathy and agreement with our aims . On Tuesday afternoon about forty people assembled in Miss Ida Lovering's studio at SANDWICH , filling the room and overflowing on to the landing . Our colours were well in evidence . The flowers which decorated the studio and even our iced cakes everywhere displayed the cheerful red , white and green . Miss Dutton's speech with its calm reasonableness and sanity of outlook appealed strongly to her Kentish audience , and we hope to be able to follow up our success by founding a society at Sandwich in the near future . For Miss Ida Lovering's zeal and invaluable help we cannot be too grateful . For Wednesday . Mrs. Percy Edgar had arranged to give a drawing - room meeting in DEAL , and Miss Dutton was to speak for the last time before leaving Kent and pro- ceeding to her new Federation . I left Deal the previous night and so was not able to be present at this third meeting of the week .

500 Irish Notes . of MISS ABADAM'S TOUR IN IRELAND . Miss Abadam has stirred the women Ireland as they have seldom hitherto been stirred . She has brought home to them a sense of how vitally necessary it is that women should have a share in the law - making of a nation . No one who has listened to Miss Abadam can ever again take life so lightly as before , nor put aside , as out of their sphere , the great and crying evils in our social organisation . Miss Abadam has a wonderful gift of oratory , and she uses it in a noble cause . Miss Abadam spoke in Belfast , Lisburn , Newry , Warrenpoint , Dublin , Cork and Water- ford . The Dublin meeting ( under the auspices of the Irishwomen's Reform League ) was held in the Mansion House ( by kind permission of the Lord Mayor ) , and close upon 1,000 women gathered there to hear Miss Abadam speak on the White Slave Traffic . It was wonderful to see that large audience held thrilled and spellbound by the speaker for nearly an hour . The primary objects of the meeting were ( 1 ) to pass a resolu- tion urging that the Criminal Law Amendment Bill be passed by the Government deleted of amendments , and ( 2 ) to establish a branch in Dublin of the Ladies ' National Vigilance Asso- ciation . The resolution was proposed by the Countess of Fingall and unanimously adopted . The committee of a vigilance association has been appointed , and it is hoped that sufficient subscriptions will be forthcoming to secure the services of an agent to watch our railway sta- tions and ports . It will be a crying disgrace to Irishwomen especially to those who had the privilege of hearing Miss Abadam speak on this subject if the money is not subscribed twice over . Miss Abadam's meetings in Warrenpoint and Newry have been successful beyond our expec- tations , although one expects some results from individual canvassing and personally addressed and delivered notices . Hundreds of women were thus notified of the meetings , and good propaganda work done beforehand . At Warren- point it was a Suffrage meeting , and the subject of the White Slave Traffic was dwelt on in order to prove the speaker's contention that all efforts to ameliorate social and moral condi- tions are practically useless , and have been use- less in the past . Miss Abadam drove it home to the most reluctant minds that this failure was owing to the political helplessness of women . They are unable to force their demand for legal remedies for social wrongs . In Newry the meeting was convened to pro- test against the nefarious traffic in girls and young women , and to call upon the Government to pass the Criminal Law Amendment Bill in the form in which it was first drafted by its promoters . Miss Abadam made a deep impres- sion upon her audience , and inspired them with some of her own enthusiasm and righteous indignation . Henceforward many will enter on a new phase in this crusade in the women's movement , and will experience the power of a fresh spiritual impulse behind their efforts . MR . SNOWDEN'S AMENDMENT L. M. C. HOME TO THE RULE BILL . The following letter has been sent to all the Nationalist Members of Parliament from the Irishwomen's Reform League : DEAR SIR , We are aware that there is a feeling amongst Irish Nationalists that Suffra- gists are acting without regard to the success of the Home Rule Bill when they demand that the Municipal Register be made the basis of repre- sentation under Home Rule . We wish once more to assert that we are , as Suffragists , sincerely non - party . We are bound in loyalty to our cause to seek representation in any form of government which may be devised for this country . We would remind you that the Irish Party are indirectly gaining much in England from the support given to the Labour Party by two large suffrage societies , the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies ( the largest women's association in England ) and the Women's Freedom League . The political help of women can no longer be regarded as neg- ligible in Ireland . We urge you , in the interest of the whole nation , to vote for Mr. Snowden's Amendment to the Home Rule Bill on October 30th . Yours truly , ELLA INGLIS , Hon . Sec . , Irishwomen's Reform League . Letters have also been sent to all the Labour Members and to Suffragist Members of the Liberal and Unionist Parties , begging them not to fail in voting for the amendment .

THE COMMON CAUSE . Ali the other suffrage societies in the Irish- women's Suffrage Federation have been busy in stirring up influence to bear upon the Irish Party with regard to this matter . The first annual meeting of the Irishwomen's Suffrage Federation will be held on Saturday , October 26th , at 2.30 p.m. , at Molesworth 33 , Street , Dublin . Miss Moser is organising a private subscrip- tion dance , to take place in the Pillar Room of the Rotunda , Dublin , on November 13th . The proceeds will be divided between the Irish- women's Suffrage Federation and the Irish- women's Reform League . The patronesses are : -The Countess of Fingall , the Hon . Mrs. Spring Rice , Hon . Mary Lawless , Lady Cowan , Mrs. Chambers , Mrs. Mason , and Mrs. West . Music : Messrs . Clarke Barry's band . Supper : Messrs . Mills . Tickets 10s . 6d . China . Foreign News . The most interesting contribution in this month's Jus Suffragii is Mrs. Chapman Catt's letter from China . The news that has hitherto reached us as to the position of women in the reconstituted state has been puzzling and con- tradictory . Now we have a clear statement of the case . That women took an important part in the recent revolution is well known . Mrs. Catt supplies interesting details . She says : " When the preparations for the revolution were being made by a secret society , called the Tung Ming Hui , women were invited to join it . It was the first time for centuries that women had been acknowledged as intelligent human beings , whose opinion and work were worth while . " Large numbers of women , especially students , flocked into the society , and performed every kind of duty assigned to men members . Many were arrested and put to death . A number formed themselves into " Dare to die " clubs and smuggled arms and ammunition into China . Later they volunteered as soldiers and were armed and drilled . Mrs. Catt thinks there must have been between two and four thousand of these " Amazons . " They were the daughters of good families and highly respectable . Most of them had begun their careers with bound feet , and had to throw off physical and moral shackles , such as can hardly be realised by Western women . It is interesting to learn that when the war was over the " Dare to die " clubs were trans- formed into suffrage societies . Never , surely , had women a better right to demand a vote . These Chinese women appeared before the con- stitutional convention , the assemblies and the National Council . They had interviews with the President and Cabinet , " Their political sagacity fills me with amazement , " says Mrs. Catt ; " nor rave these women learned their lessons from our Western papers , for few of them read any other language than Chinese . Their plan of campaign seems to be of their own devising . There are many clubs in China , and some thousands of women are striving for the vote . " They are hoping to enter the Inter- national Alliance and to send delegates to Buda- pest . The women in the Canton province have actually voted for their provisional assembly , and women members have found a place in it . But no other Chinese women have as yet had a vote , nor is it probable that the franchise will be confirmed to the women of Canton . Chinese women , like their Western sisters , will have to work hard and long before they achieve real equality , but as Mrs. Catt points out , " it is marvellous enough that a thousand women in Peking want to vote , and that there are several suffrage clubs of two thousand members . The Chinese , like the tortoise in the fable , may yet outstrip the Western hare in the race towards the goal of justice for women . " Iceland . summer . The hopes of Icelandic women for enfran- chisement this year have not been realised . It had been hoped that the Constitution Bill which was passed last year would be ratified by the extraordinary session of the Althing held this In that case all men and women over 25 years of age would have been enfranchised . Owing to a complication with regard to the Danish - Icelandic question the postponement of last year's Bill was agreed on . This delay will postpone the enfranchisement of women for two , possibly even three years . That it will be passed when the Constitution Bill is adopted there appears to be no doubt whatever . But the delay is the more regrettable that women will not now be able to vote in the referendum that will have to be taken if a new treaty of union

Meantime they are taking their share in municipal politics , voting in good numbers , though there , as in England , the dominance of party politics often prevents the nomination or election of a woman to the councils . Servia . The following letter has been received by the Press Secretary of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies from Mlle . Losanitch , one of the Secretaries of the National Union of Servian Women : - I thank you most heartily for your sympathy in regard to the war , which I think shall be declared in a day or two . I have got Mrs. Fawcett's latest speech , which I read with greatest interest and am very sorry not being able to publish it here in Servian newspapers under circumstances of war . The ladies of the Servian Council are just now very busy , some are following the nursing course , others are organising hospitals , some of them are sewing linen for the wounded soldiers ; the vivacity is great , the enthusiasm is enormous !! We are longing that the war begins in order to deliver our brethren and to throw off the Turkish yoke of which they suffered bitterly . Believe me to be yours very sincerely , E. LOSANITCH . P.S.

Associations Truly Liberal , The following letters have been addressed by Mrs. Fawcett to the President of the Lancashire and Cheshire W.L.A. and the Chairman of the Welsh Liberal Association . Copies are being sent to the Press : - MY DEAR MADAM , -Pray allow me to offer , on behalf of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , our very hearty thanks and congratulations on the splendid resolution recently adopted by the Lancashire and Cheshire Women's Liberal Association to the effect that they would strike work on behalf of the Liberal Party if an Enfranchisement Bill were passed which did not include women . I feel that if each group of Societies will do its very utmost to secure the enfranchisement of women each in its own way , but without the resort to physical violence which weakens and alienates public opinion , the goal for which we have been working so long will soon be reached . Again thanking you for the powerful and timely support given to our great Cause by your Association . -Believe me , dear Madam , ( Signed ) MILLICENT GARRETT FAWCETT ( For the Executive Committee of the N.U.W.S.S. ) October 21 , 1912 . Lord St. Davids - Sir , -At a recent meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Women Suffrage Societies , I was requested to convey to you our appreciation of the great service recently rendered to the Cause of Women's Enfranchisement by the resolution adopted by your Association on the motion , I believe , of our good friend Sir Alfred Mond , in favour of including some form of representation for women in

OCTOBER 24 , 1912 . the Government Franchise and Registration Bill . We feel that every argument , which has ever been used in favour of the enfranchisement of successive groups of men , is equally applicable to women , and we believe that Liberalism is weakened and rendered odious when it draws back from the application of the principles it has always professed on the subject of the repre- sentation of the people . No one can say that your Association has done this , and we cordially thank you for the most useful and timely resolutions you recently adopted endorsing the claim of women to citizenship . -Believe me , dear Sir , Yours faithfully , ( Signed ) M. G. FAWCETT ( For the Executive Committee of the N.U.W.S.S. ) October 21 , 1912 . Letters to the Editor .

The Editor is not responsible for any statement made in the correspondence column . Correspondents are requested to write ON ONE SIDE OF THE PAPER ONLY . THE COUNCIL MEETING AT MANCHESTER . Upon reading Mr. H. G. Barclay's letter in the COMMON CAUSE ( October 17th ) containing criticisms of the methods of conducting the business of the Council , I feel that it is only fair to the Chairman and the Execu- tive Committee that the impressions received by another of the male members of the Council should also find expression . Mr. Barclay bears well - deserved testimony in the earier part of his letter to the ability and absolute fairness of Mrs. Fawcett as Chairman , and this hardly prepares us for some of his later sentences , although we must fully admit the friendly and moderate spirit in which he writes . I was present , with two other representatives from our Society , throughout the proceedings on both days , and we could not detect the slightest lapse from im- partiality at any time on the part of our Chairman . I am sure that the gentlemen representatives from Macclesfield , who moved and seconded the resolution that Mr. Barclay refers to , will admit that their speeches were longer than the average of other non - official speakers , and if they were the first who were requested to be brief , they were certainly not the only ones . Reference to the Agenda would show how necessary it was that progress should be made as rapidly as possible , and subsequently a time - limit had to be adopted as otherwise some of the later business could not have been adequately discussed . Looking back upon the meetings I feel convinced that the Executive Committee fully merited the support and confidence that were accorded to them by the large majority of those present . Ample discussion was not only invited but was fully allowed , and it was very evident that whatever method of voting had been adopted the result in no single instance would have been different . CHARLES G. BOULLEN , Hon . Sec . Ambleside and District W.S.S. Oct. 18th , 1912 . THE VAN VISIT TO CHELTENHAM . As the Van report says that the Cheltenham week was the least satisfactory of any during the whole tour , I hope you will allow me to say a word , for such a state- ment is apt to reflect on the Branch , however little it may be meant to do so . If ours was the worst week , I can only rejoice to know what a splendid success the tour must have been , for the work here was by no means a failure . The account in THE COMMON CAUSE of the Monday night meeting did not half do justice to its character . The gathering was as large as most of our by - election crowds , and as to orderliness , I never saw a more perfectly behaved collection of men and women . Even the seller of " Suffrage whips " in the colours did not divert the people , and the inner circle of small boys stood mute and still , gazing in awe at our speakers . The meeting next evening at Prestbury was very nearly being a fiasco - for the reason that Miss Gill was preparing for departure , and so could not distribute the handbills herself , and instead gave them to the Gordon Boys ' Home with detailed instructions and an extra fee to ensure inspection by an official of the distribution- the result of all which was that no bills whatever were given out . However , when the three vanners and I arrived on the scene we set to work then and there , with the consequence that a fair meeting was got together . The three meetings planned for the previous week certainly fell through , the first through Miss Gill's illness , the other two owing to the unusual harvest conditions and unlooked - for village outings . Still , the attempt to hold these two was not wasted work , and one of them will probably lead to an indoor meeting being held this autumn . Two thousand handbills had been printed , and the filling up of these with different dates , etc. , and their distribution , mainly by two persons within four or five days , did not precisely leave very much time for lounging in hammocks . Mortal woman could not do more , and if the vanners regarded the result as a failure , it cannot be helped . THEODORA MILLS . The Vanners met with very great success in certain parts of the country , and in others chiefly owing to the bad weather - they had to abandon meetings . No pre - arranged meetings were abandoned , so far as my memory serves me , in the Norfolk month , and only one , I think , in the West Lancs . , West Cheshire and North Wales fortnight . During the seventeen days of execrable weather spent in hurrying across England from Norfolk


### Column 1

THE COMMON CAUSE . to Cheshire , four or five places were passed through without any attempt to hold meetings there . No advertising had been done at these places , the rain poured down unceasingly , and the Van usually arrived at them in the late afternoon . In the Cheltenham week , three meetings had to be abandoned , one of them because the Organiser was ill . The other two were well advertised during the day by the entire Van crew of three , who distributed the printed handbills supplied by the Society , at practically every house . The weather was cold , but there was no rain . Not a single person came to the first of these meetings , and only four or five turned up for the other . ( We spent about twenty minutes in informal talk with these . ) The meeting at Prestbury , unadvertised owing to a stroke of real mis- fortune in the shape of truant Gordon Home messengers , consisted of three or four adults and about ten children . The Van reporters , while realising that the canvassing , etc. , was all to the good at the villages where meetings were planned but not held , only stated the bald truth when they said that the Cheltenham campaign was the least satisfactory that they had engaged in during the three months ' tour . No one regrets it more than the Vanners , and their sympathy is all with the Cheltenham Society . As for the meeting held in Cheltenham itself , all the Vanners agree that it was a most orderly one , and that there was a good attendance . This , however , did not strike them as anything out of the way , since their experience of open - air meetings , with one or two excep- tions , had led them to expect orderly meetings and good crowds , even in villages , and where no branch of the National Union existed . I myself congratulated the police constable upon the orderliness of the children , as we always made it a practice to do where we conscien- tiously could ! I think I speak for the other members of the Van party when I say that we should be only too delighted if the Van's visit to Cheltenham had succeeded in stirring up new enthusiasm for our cause in the district , and thus been of real service to the Branch . We were very sorry that our visit should have happened to come in the summer holiday time and that thus we should not have had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of any of its members . No doubt if they had been able to come to the assistance of Mrs. Swiney and Miss Mills in arranging for the Van's visit we should not have had to record our " least satisfactory campaign as having taken place in Cheltenham . Only then it would have been somewhere else ! VERA C. C. COLLUM . 4 , Milton Chambers , 128 , Cheyne Walk , S.W. October 21st , 1912 . An Offer to Readers of Common Cause . " " The Mr. Hillcoat , of 173 , Piccadilly , offers to readers of THE COMMON CAUSE an opportunity of obtaining tickets at half - price for the Annual Motor Show at Olympia ( November 8th to 15th ) . Applications , stating the number and price of tickets required , should be made to him before October 30th .

Other Societies . THE WOMEN'S MARCH . - EDINBURGH TO LONDON . The Women's March has accomplished 107 miles of its journey , and nothing could be more gratifying than the cordial reception and kind hospitality it has every- where received . Reports which reach us tell of good meetings , large audiences and an enthusiastic eagerness to sign the great petition . Places visited during the coming week will be Northallerton 24th , Thirsk 25th , Easingwold 26th and 27th , York 28th , Selby 29th , Doncaster 30th . Names of recruits , donations and offers of hospitality to be addressed Mrs. de Fonblanque , c.o. Miss Roff , Easebourne , Midhurst . Sussex . It is hoped that all who possibly can will give this enterprise their warmest support . A TAX RESISTANCE SALE . Mrs. Fyffe had her goods sold for refusal to pay income tax on Thursday last at Whiteley's Auction Rooms , where , by courtesy of the auctioneer , Mrs. Louis Fagan made a speech of protest , which was received with much sympathy . The forming up of the procession at Mrs. Fyffe's resi- dence in Kensington Court , with the John Hampden banner at its head , caused great interest and excitement in that quiet and respectable locality , and a large and very attentive audience listened at the protest meeting held afterwards in Chepstow Place . The speakers were Mrs. Cobden Sanderson , Mrs. Louis Fagan , Miss Andrews and the Rev. Charles Baumgarten , Rector of St. George's , Bloomsbury , who also gave a Benediction at the close of the meeting , and the following resolution was carried , with only two dissentients : " That this meeting protests against the seizure and sale of Mrs. Fyffe's goods , and is of opinion that the tax - paying women of this country are justified in refusing to pay all Imperial taxes until they are allowed a voice in deciding how these large sums of money shall be spent . " THE ACTRESSES ' FRANCHISE LEAGUE . The cast for the play , " The First Actress , " by Christopher St. John , which will be given at the Actresses ' Franchise League Matinee on November 29th at the Lyceum Theatre , will include Miss Marie Tempest ( engagements permitting ) , Miss Janette Steer , Mrs. Saba Raleigh , Miss Lilian Braithwaite , Miss Henrietta Watson , Miss Lena Ashwell , Miss Nora Lancaster , Mr. Ben Webster , Miss Evelyn D'Alroy and Mr. Tom Heslewood .
