Notwithstanding the precautions , how- ever , a woman in the hall asked Sir Edward Grey when he intended to give votes to women , but was not answered until after the Licensing Bill had been dealt with . Meanwhile , other women held a great protest meeting on the steps of the Liberal Club opposite , and at its close , accompanied by an enormous crowd , marched to the stage door , by which it was expected the Minister would leave .

Though the Liberal agents had evidently determined that the evening should pass without Mr. Harcourt's attention being dis- tracted by the question of votes for women , there were women on the spot whose determination was at least equal to theirs , for on Mr. Harcourt's very unostentatious arrival at the hall , he was fol- lowed into the vestibule by a woman who dexterously evaded threatened ejection long enough to present him with the current number of VOTES FOR WOMEN . Mr. Harcourt was obviously dis- concerted , but finally accepted it . He subsequently received two telegrams , the first , which arrived early in the meeting , contained the words : "" Scottish women not secure demand political justice . "" The second , arriving at question time , demanded : "" When is the Liberal Government going to give votes to women ? "" Mr. Harcourt stated that he had received a courteous note on the subject from a lady , to which he replied , curiously enough , in a speech of studied discourtesy , an attitude which did the sympathy of his audience , who demanded a speech in return . This having been briefly complied with , many of them left the hall to report progress to the women outside , and encouraged them with three cheers and shouts of "" Votes for Women ! "" Mr. Harcourt evidently lacked courage to face the women again ; his nerve was plainly shaken , and he escaped modestly by a side door .",,,,,"November 26, 1908"
