Unknown,Royal Albert Hall,"One of the most successful meetings of the Women's Social and Political Union was held on Thursday in last week at the Royal Albert Hall, when the following resolution was carried, with only one dissentient voice : This Meeting condemns the dishonourable and unprincipled tactics employed by successive Governments in order to defraud women of their right to the Parliamentary Vote . The Meeting demands the immediate cessation of these tactics , and calls for the enactment of the Conciliation Bill in 1911. And further , the Meeting calls upon women to unite in determined militant protest against any attempt on the part of the Prime Minister to prevent this measure of justice being carried into law during the present Session of Parliament .",Meeting of the Women's Social and Political Union,"['Miss Vida Goldstein', 'Miss Christabel Pankhurst']",Unknown,,"March 31, 1911"
