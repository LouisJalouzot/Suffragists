How History is Written . 318 320 On the 25th there was a leading article in " The Nation which makes one well - nigh despair of the in- telligence of its author . Anyone so ignorant of the true history of the Suffrage movement might , one would think , have had the modesty to refrain from comment- ing on it . The writer alludes to this " five - year - old agita- tion for securing the Parliamentary vote to some women . Has he , then , never heard of the great agitation started by John Stuart Mill , worked for by devoted men and women like Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy , Lydia Becker , Jacob Bright , and others ; of the petitions , one of them signed by over a quarter of a million ; of the innumerable Bills and resolutions ? He says the election of 1906 " yielded a majority of votes - for the most part a careless and unthinking majority ( the one piece of only too accurate informa- tion ) for some kind of a Suffrage Bill on democratic

No one before then ever offered women the vote on democratic lines . The Suffrage Societies never had but one qualification for the vote- " the same as men " -and this qualification was always accepted until last year , when , under sinister advice , Mr. Asquith invented a phrase which has been such an excel- lent excuse for doing nothing . But it is the first sentence of this precious article which members of the National Union will most griev- ously resent . It runs thus : " We hope that the general body of women Suffragists will pause before they give their leaders full authority to pursue the tactics of violence which have been formally adopted and acted upon at Birmingham and elsewhere . " The monstrous misrepresentation which this suggests is one of those which are apt to pass uncontradicted at first , just because they are so monstrous , and then , later , they do their insidious , poisonous work . " The general body of women Suffragists " consists of hundreds of thousands of women who never have given anyone authority to pursue tactics of violence . If the writer were not ashamed to so traduce the National Union , one wonders that he could involve the unhappy women Liberals , the Co - operative Guild , and all the other great organisations of women demand- ing their enfranchisement . The W.S.P.U. is a small , though very vigorous , association of women avowedly defying law and order ; but they are not our " leaders , and we indignantly disclaim any of the responsibility with which The Nation " would saddle us . * Making it Clear . 39 Some people are very difficult to please . In a letter to the paper last week , Miss Margaret Ashton ( of the National Union ) wrote , using Lord Crewe's words , and saying it is " absolutely needless and superfluous to say that I regard the breaking up or disturbing of meetings with the strongest disapproval . We all agree that to disturb meetings of opponents is both wrong and foolish . I regret it greatly if meetings have been disturbed at all . I protest once more very strongly and indignantly against any sort of suggestion or innuendo that such proceedings have the sympathy of constitutional Suffragists , and still more against any suggestion that we are in any way responsible for them . This does not do for Mrs. Tattersall , of the Liberal Women's Suffrage League . She wishes to dictate the words , otherwise she will continue to misunderstand the sense of our words . One would have thought Miss Ashton's condemnation of rowdyism clear and cate- gorical . But no . Miss Ashton is asked to " reconsider her position . Miss Ashton disclaims all idea of responsibility . That is true in one sense . But if we have not done all in our power to circumvent the militante , or , at any rate , made it clear that we view their proceed- ings with horror and detestation , then in that degree we are responsible . The naiveté of the suggestion that we should " circumvent " the militants can only make us smile . We regard that as the business of the police , and Mrs. Tattersall need only ask herself whether a body of women who would listen to no representations from fellow - women working in the same cause that they should refrain from disturbing the great Liberal women's meet- ing in the Albert Hall , are likely to listen now , when they have been driven still further along the path of

310 THE COMMON unreason . Mrs. Tattersall requires that we should " make it clear - but to whom ? To any fair - minded person Miss Ashton's letter is clear , and those who don't want to understand will continue to misrepresent us . It takes two people for an understanding : we say plainly and simply that our leaders have never done , abetted , recom- mended , or condoned violence , and those who try to foist upon them the responsibility for it are guilty of bearing false witness . Our Irresponsible Rulers . It appeared from questions in the House on the 27th that forcible feeding had been resorted to by the prison authorities in at least one case out of ten women who were voluntarily fasting in a Birmingham prison . Con- siderable differences appear , in the various accounts of the nature of the operation and its legality , and we presume that the legality at least will be fully tested . That the operation is intensely disagreeable and disgusting no one denies ; that it is sometimes dangerous to life seems also not uncertain ; that decency required the subject should be discussed in the House with gravity and a due sense of responsibility we should have thought obvious to all . Yet some of our legislators , with a levity that approaches weak - wittedness , laughed when the matter was under dis- cussion in the House . What strikes one incessantly in the whole of this wretched business is the lack of any real sense of responsi- bility on the part of those who should be responsible to the people , but who regard themselves as responsible to men only . It is commonly assumed to be quite enough answer to any protest against undue severity or brutality that the House or the Government or the Prime Minister have " received provocation . ' But this plea is not per- missible . The representatives of the nation , the members of the Government , have no right to yield to provocation . Pique , temper , or uncomprehending obstinacy are not qualities which adorn a statesman ; we need not admire or even excuse them in private persons , but at least private persons have been given no public authority , and it does not much matter what they do . For the Government of a great nation like this to yield to annoyance at the unwise vexations of a small and irresponsible group of rebels , is to hold up the country to public derision . Our Lesson . In the meanwhile , the lesson for Suffragists to keep steadily learning from all these wearisome follies is that the worst part of wrong is that it breeds wrong : that in- difference is met by impatience , and impatience by irrita- tion , and irritation by violence , and violence by coercion and obstinacy , and these by unnameable horrors . The recent articles in " Votes for Women " make this dreary sequence so plain that no words of ours can make it plainer . Each " move " is countered by another move , " To " until we are brought logically - oh ! terribly logically to our present , or a worse , condition . quote from an excellent letter by Mr. Cobden Sanderson , in Tuesday's " Daily News , " one would be glad if the women's movement , a thing new - born into the world , would draw its inspiration from its own great future , and not from the past of violent victories won by men . Incitement to Assasination . The Birmingham " Gazette of September 18th ridi- cules the " milk and water " rebellion of the Suffragettes , and says : " If the Suffragettes believed that Mr. Asquith was so dangerous to their cause that the only thing was to put him out of the way , and if thereupon they pro- ceeded to stab him as he walked down to the House , they would be acting brutally , but they would be acting intelligibly . ' The mind to whom brutality is peculiarly intelligible is certainly a peculiar mind . Mr. Haldane's sneer about pin - pricks was unwise , but this is worse . More Claims for the Vote . The revision courts have been the scene of further interesting claims . The following appeared in Times as The At Farnham , Miss May Anne Ehretia Milton claimed , a lodger , the Parliamentary vote . She said her

CAUSE . SEPTEMBER 30 , 1909 . claim was based on the Representation of the People Act , 1884 , section 2 , which dealt with lodger votes , and the Interpretation Act , 1889 , section 1 , which stated " in this Act and in every Act passed after the year 1850 , unless the contrary intention appears , words importing the mas- culine gender shall include females . Both Acts , she sub- mitted , were passed long after the question of Woman Suffrage had come to the front . The Barrister ( Mr. J. Raymond ) said he was afraid that he could not allow the claim , and it was struck out . The assistant overseer asked whether if a large number of such claims were made the assistant overseers would be bound to insert them in the lists . The Barrister : Yes , I think so . The assistant overseer : We may have 500 , and the expense of printing them would be great . The Barrister : However ground- less you may think the claim to be , you must insert it in the list . At Lancaster it appeared that a man whose wife is detained as a pauper lunatic may vote . In Manchester a . young man who had failed to get the lodger vote cried pathetically : " What am I to do ? It seems to me the only way I can get a vote is to get married and have a house of my own ! ' A Curious Case At the Birmingham Revision Court , a married woman actually succeeded in being put on the register for the Municipal vote , which has been declared impossible out of London . It will be interesting to know whether this can be upheld . A clause in the Municipal Corporations Act expressly stated that sex and marriage should be no bar , but lawyers have hitherto succeeded in circumvent- ing the intention of the House by the interpretation they . put upon the Act . Types of Members of Parliament impressions of our rulers . Dr. Constance Long divided The Freedom League pickets have been giving their them into : The type whose hat won't come off , the type which raises its hat politely , the type that looks the other way , the type that looks and smiles superciliously , and the type that can't walk perfectly straight in the early morning . William Lloyd Garrison . On September 12th , at Lexington , Massachusetts , died William Lloyd Garrison , one of the best friends of liberty . He was the second of the seven children of the great anti - slavery leader . Although he was engaged in business up to the year 1902 , Mr. Garrison was a born reformer , and consistently protested all his life against race discrimination in the South , the disfranchisement of women , the exclusion of the Chinese , and the oppression of subject peoples . He was a lifelong supporter of the State and National Women's Suffrage Societies , and his speaking is said to have been finished and convincing . The Minority Report . A most interesting correspondence is going on in the " Christian Commonwealth " upon the Minority Report , Mrs. Webb inviting questions which she answers in that lucid style of hers , which does not disdain to be per- suasive because it has such solid foundations . In the issue of September 22nd she discussed the question whether the interferences recommended would unduly interfere with personal liberty . Our Cartoon . This week , for the first time , we include a cartoon in the number . Wales has been so consistently Liberal for many years that we may trust the Welsh to back the Chancellor in supporting women's claims , when once they understand that the interruption of meetings from which he has suffered is not the policy of any but a very small section of Suffragists .

SEPTEMBER 30 , 1909 . THE COMMON un- The Reform Bill . The air is full of rumours of dissolution . Whether the House of Lords attempts to throw out or to amend the Finance Bill , whether it will really act as the Chamber for forcing a Referendum on the Budget , no one on either side seems really to know . Threats and counter - threats are hurled about , and editors , ministers , and politicians generally seem to be in as high a state of emotionalism and variability as the legendary representatives of the weaker sex are supposed to be . We are sometimes twitted with being political , " with not knowing " how things are done " ; but though this has some truth in it , and though there are undeniable disadvantages in our unworldly adherance to principles and in our ignorance and contempt of wire - pulling , these very qualities have their solid and quite permanent advantages when matters are as fluid and incalculable as at present . Even the nimblest opportunism sometimes over - reaches itself , and where nothing more steady is to be built upon than the average politician , we think that it is on the whole safer to trust to the electors , to " broaden the basis of our support , and to appeal to the common - sense of the average man . " 3 All prophets ( except the Liberal Whip , who , for obvious reasons , is the last person to give any real information ) agree that we shall have a dissolution very soon . Some say late autumn , some say early in 1910. What concerns us is the prospect of a Reform Bill before the dissolution , and as no member of the Government ever willingly talks about this Reform Bill , we must , at the risk of being tedious , repeat some important points about it . One of the rebukes most constantly administered to suffragists is on the score of their " ignorance " in not knowing that a Reform Bill can only be introduced immediately before a dissolution . As a matter of fact , we all know perfectly well that this is English precedent , but we have never been able to admit anything peculiarly sacred about precedent ( perhaps because there is no precedent for much that women are asking for ) , and we think that trifling inconveniences might well yield to the pressure of a great necessity . Many of us , how- ever , perhaps most of us , would have been quite willing to wait with patience until just before a disso- lution , if we had been given any public pledge from the Prime Minister that our reform would be dealt with then . No such pledge , however , was given until May 20 , 1908 , and very few of the people who talk glibly of " Mr. Asquith's promise " have ever taken the trouble to understand precisely what he said then . This famous pronouncement was made not to women , nor to the representatives of any Women's Suffrage societies ( Mr. Asquith has declined to meet any deputa- tion of Women Suffragists , whether orderly or dis- orderly , from the day he became Premier ) ; it was made to Liberal Members of Parliament . It is not the place here to say what we think were the motives which determined him , nor what we think of the conditions of his pledge . His pledge was to bring in a Reform Bill before the dissolution of this Parliament , and to leave an amendment in favour of Women's Suffrage to the free choice of the House . The Government would not oppose the amendment , and therefore , if it passed , it would become part of the Government Reform Bill . 33 Now this statement was received with enthusiasm by the Liberal Suffragist Members of Parliament , and with intense disappointment by non - party Women Suffragists all over the country ; but Mr. Asquith is absolutely bound in honour by this promise , which he made to men , and which was accepted by men . Neither he nor they asked the women what they thought of it ; they did not consult us ; it is their scheme ; they are morally bound to put it through ; they would not accept our solution ; on them it rests to work out their own . Where is this Reform Bill and when are they going to put it through ? Liberals all over the country have


### Column 1

CAUSE . << C CE CC 311 refused to speak on our question , because they said , Your turn will come over the Reform Bill " ; Mr. Asquith has refused to receive any deputations , because his promise is on record and he has nothing to add " ; Lady Carlisle keeps the Liberal women docile with trust in Mr. Asquith's promise " ; Lady McLaren has plainly spoken of the wrath to come should the Reform Bill evaporate . So it seems we are to have the Reform Bill sprung upon us , full grown and armed , like Athena from the head of Zeus - but when ? " A Reform Bill can only be passed at the end of a Parliament . " So be it ; but the end is very near . The danger to a Reform Bill is always this that if it is to come only at the end of a Parliament , a dissolution may be precipitated by the rejection of some measure by the House of Lords ; and where the Government is notoriously unwilling to bring in the Reform Bill , the temptation is great to make the Lords the excuse for a breech of faith . Such a breech of faith would in this case be peculiarly despicable , for the Liberals have never denied the justice of our claim , but they have made the violent and disorderly action of a small body of rebels the excuse for subjecting all women to humiliating restrictions and for entering into a conspiracy of silence on the real issue , while they cloud the air with incessant babble about the militants . The militants and the Government between them have created a ridiculous and intolerable situation . We are not to be diverted . We want our liberty . The action of a few hundreds of women , wrong and foolish as we think it , can not be admitted as an excuse for refusing justice to the millions who have never pursued or advocated such action . It is no part of a true Statesman to be governed by mere temper . No one , not Mr. Lloyd - George himself , who has more than once been the victim of violence , can hate it more than the members of the National Union . Is it not a cruel and senseless irony to tell Liberal Women , whose great meeting in the Albert Hall was ravaged by the W.S.P.U. , that they cannot be given the vote because the W.S.P.U. is wrong - headed and vindictive ? 61 We do not forget that Mr. Lloyd - George then said : My conviction is that you will never get really good effective measures for housing , for temperance , or for other social reforms until you get the millions of the women of the land to co - operate in such legislation . It is for that reason that I am standing here to - day , to declare that in my judgment it is not merely the right of woman , but the interest of all that you should call in the aid , the counsel , the inspiration of woman to help in the fashioning of legislation which will improve , cleanse , purify , and fill with plenty the homes upon which the future destiny of this great commonwealth of nations depends . " An Equitable Adjustment . The new principle introduced by the Prime Minister of what he is pleased to call " equity of taxation between unearned and earned increment is a matter of the first importance for women . Because under the present state of things a large proportion of women's incomes ( if they have any ) comes under the head of unearned increment . And that for a simple enough reason , they are not allowed to hold lucrative posts and appoint- ments . On the new principle the lawyer or cabinet minister or official who earns £ 2,000 a year is taxed at the rate of 9d . in the £ , whilst the widow , whose husband has been able to leave her £ 500 a year to bring up three , four , or five children on , has to pay 1s . 2d . in the £ . It is curious to think of all the opposition there has been amongst men to women entering the professional world . The women doctors ' fight is fresh in all our minds , and even now they are excluded from public appointments and handicapped in competition by men's prejudice against women earning money . Now another turn is being given to the screw . Those of us that the

312 6 THE COMMON authorities have prevented from earning they are going to fine for being dependent . Take a prosperous man leaving his business to his son , and a small independent income to his daughter . The son earns perhaps £ 800 a year in the business , the daughter , who has no earning power , lives on the £ 300 a year . She has been brought up on the same level , with the same needs as her brother , she is left very much poorer , she has indeed to change her whole way of living . The Prime Minister proposes to make taxation more equitable , " by counting her as one of the parasite rich and idle , and him as one of the deserving poor whose burden is to be lightened . It is amusing to see how people try to eat their cake and have it at the same time . They say women's place is the home , at one moment , and at the next they tax them for staying there . They also say that the service a mother renders to the State by bringing up children is one of the most valuable in the world , and at the same time they are going to tax every mother whose husband is dead , and who devotes herself to her children , as an idle drone with an unearned income . The earnings of women are , as it is , very low in every class , in fact there are comparatively so few of them who are in a position to pay income tax on their earnings , that the relief of 5d . in the £ designed to help prosperous business and professional men will be of little benefit to any women except a few doctors , head schoolmistresses , shop - keepers , etc. In view of this fact it was very interesting at a meeting of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women's Suffrage Society to hear Mrs. Stansfield explain the present attack on the incomes of married women teachers . Mrs. Stansfield is herself a head teacher in a girls ' school at Warrington and she and Mrs. Cann ( Superintendent of Cookery Instruction ) both received notice of dismissal from the Education Committee this year on the grounds of their marriage . In the case of Mrs. Stansfield , who works in a non - provided school , the Committee withdrew their notice on the threat of the National Union of Teachers to take the matter into Court . But Mrs. Cann has had to pay with her whole income and life- interest for her reprehensible action in marrying , more than 19 years ago . Her earned income is forcibly taken from her , if she were so fortunate as to have an unearned one she would be taxed at a higher rate than other people for daring to be idle . So that whatever she does is wrong . When women once understand the two new theories that are gradually creeping into our English law , that by marrying they lose their liberty to earn ( the first primitive right of every human being ) and at the same time that those who do not earn have no right to possess , they will see that social changes of a far - reaching kind must inevitably follow . Marriage will come to be looked on as a disastrous folly of youth , and the more thrifty , wise , and energetic of their sex will not be found any longer among the mothers . The only tolerable position for a woman under the new dispensation will be that of an unmarried worker . These are very practical matters , the attack on unearned increments is a serious blow at the position of that hitherto independent section of English women whom circumstances have not yet forced into the industrial struggle to compete for the wretchedly inadequate salaries and wages which are obtainable at present , and the attack on the income of the married worker will rob those who have no independent means of the power to earn . There is no consideration of these questions in Parliament . So falsely have the different parties in the House of Commons used a pretended consideration for women's claims as a mask for some transparent political motive , that at the mention of the position of widows with regard to taxation everyone laughs and sneers ! And there are women left in England to - day who cannot see the crying necessity for our enfranchisement as a protection before the incomes , the earning power , and the in- dependence of women are legislated away by the in- difference , ignorance , and jealousy of an assembly of

Joint Incomes . The Finance Bill took up the whole time of the House of Commons durlng the past week , while the House of Lords was busy amending the Housing and Town Planning Bill . On Monday , Mr. Joynson Hicks again protested against the taxing of the husband's and wife's incomes as one . He did not want he said ,, to drag in the question of women's suffrage ( why not ? ) but it seemed to him that this was unjust to both husband and wife and doubly unjust to the wife , because she was taxed without having the slightest representation in the House of Commons . Some Exemptions . On the question of exemptions or abatements on income tax for persons living abroad , which was dis- cussed on Wednesday , Mr. Lloyd George agreed to allow exemptions to any person who is or has been employed in the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands , and any person the service of the Crown abroad , any person resident in is so resident for the sake of health . " The claim of resident abroad who satisfies the Commissioners that he those who were , to use Mr. Chamberlain's phrase , exiles of poverty 39 was not allowed . Tea Duty . On Thursday , 23rd , Mr. Snowden made a spirited attack on the tea duty , complaining that it hit the poor housewife very hard . The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government had already reduced the tea duty from sixpence to fivepence and could not reduce it further , because they had had to find eight or nine millions for old age pensions . Making Work for Lawyers . In the discussion on Clause 64 a laughable " explana- tion " was given . Subsection 7 reads : ' Sections 8 and 33 9 of the Finance Act , 1901 , as amended by section 2 of the Revenue Act , 1903 , shall apply with respect to the manufacture of and dealing in motor spirit as they apply with respect to the manufacture of saccharin , and any provisions of the Spirit Act , 1880 , or any Acts amending that Act , may be applied by regulations made in pursu- ance of this sub - section to motor spirit . " Sir Edward Carson objected that it would take him a weeks hard work to ascertain the meaning and extent of the subsection . The Financial Secretary to the Treasury referred enquirers to the Sugar Convention Act whereat Mr. T. M. Healy drily remarked that it now appeared that in order to ascertain his liabilities under the sub - section the small village dealer would have to make himself acquainted not only with the various statutes therein referred to but also with the Sugar Convention Act .

THE COMMON NATIONAL UNION OF WOMEN'S OBJECT : To obtain the Parliamentary vote for women on METHODS : By orderly propaganda and public discussion to upon the Members of Parliament . The Union is MRS . HENRY Hon . Secretary : MISS EDITH DIMOCK . Telegrams : " Voiceless , London . " President Offices : 25 , Victoria Street , The Executive Committee . The Executive Committee are busy considering plans for developing the work all over the country this autumn . New schemes are being formed for uniting and organis- ing special districts for thorough local campaigns . Besides the Organisation Committee for Surrey , Hants . , and Sussex , mentioned last week , and that for Herts . , Bucks . , and Bedfordshire , there is a suggestion for organising the Western Counties under the same kind of committee composed of representatives of the local societies . In co - operation with the London Society , also , it is hoped to arrange public meetings in the London area , and among the many advantages of these schemes it may fairly be expected that the oppor- tunity for wider co - operation and larger fields of action which they will afford will result in a decided increase of energy and enthusiasm among local workers . Other matters of grave importance to the N.U.W.S.S. will come before the Executive Committee at its next meeting on Thursday , 30th inst . Serious consideration will be given to the extremely difficult situation in which constitutional suffragists are now placed by the most recent developments in the policy and action of the militant section ; and in addition to this a special meeting of the Committee in the morning will discuss the policy to be pursued by the N.U.W.S.S. when the General Election takes place . Passing events seem to show that it is well to be prepared for all emergencies . Arrangements are quickly approaching completion for the holding of the Quarterly Council Meeting , which will take place at Cardiff , in the Whitehall Rooms , Park Hotel , on Wednesday , October 6 , at 10-30 a.m. The Cardiff Society have arranged a reception for delegates and friends on the evening of Tuesday , October 5 , and the Council Meeting will be followed on Wednesday evening by a public meeting at which Mrs. Fawcett and Councillor Margaret Ashton will speak . On Tuesday afternoon a meeting for Secre- taries of Societies will be held to be followed by a meeting to which Members , Delegates , and Secretaries are invited , to discuss " The Common Cause news- paper as the organ of the National Union . Suggestions as to possible ways of increasing the circulation and advertisements of the paper will be gratefully welcomed at this meeting by the editor - manager , Mrs. Swanwick . The Cardiff Society are working hard and have borrowed Miss Helga Gill from the National Union to help for a fortnight . We are glad to report that Miss Bertha Mason has returned to town , and proposes very shortly to give a series of lectures illustrating the history and develop- ment of the Suffrage movement . The lectures will be accompanied by lantern slides giving the portraits of well - known Suffragist leaders , and should prove an attractive form of propagandist work . The Literature Sub - Committee would be very glad to receive suggestions as to means of making the work of this department more strikingly effective . They are considering several new departures , and will soon have some new posters and postcards , and some red and white wrappers under the pleasing cover of which suffrage leaflets may be easily pressed into the willing hands of unsuspecting friends . What they chiefly want , however , are original ideas or designs for booklets , calendars , or any suitable trifles to help to turn suffrage literature stalls into very spider's webs for attractive- ness , and make Christmas gifts for all good Suffragists . Here is scope for all kinds of artistic talent , and the Literature Sub - Committee have great hopes that some members will be glad to know of this way of helping

But they want thoughtful original literature too , they want to have every point of view of the women's movement represented amongst their publications so that every one may know not only that women want the vote , but know too the way in which they want to use it . They need some very simple leaflets for the many and they need too , more and more , intellectual food for the few .

My last words to the friends and supporters of the National Union as I left England in July for a much- needed rest were : " £ 2,000 is urgently needed by the end of September , if our work is to be carried on and satis- factorily extended . " My first words on returning home and resuming the publication of the financial lists and notes on behalf of the Union are to the same effect : " £ 2,000 is urgently needed before the end of September . " Towards this sum I have in hand ( including the balance of the_sums guaranteed by friends for the expenses of the Inter- national Congress , amounting to £ 166 11s . ) £ 1,713 17s . 1d . Half - a - dozen gifts of £ 50 , or a dozen of £ 25 each , would make up the sum I want . There is still a month before our financial year closes . Will some generous friends come forward with these amounts , so that I may include them in the year's receipts before our books are closed for audit ? The sums received during my absence from Societies ( see list ) through " Special efforts " amount to £ 250 , all but 9s . 9d . For these I now tender my warm and cordial thanks . Little has come in during August and this month . The holidays doubtless account for this slackness . Now that they are over , and workers are returning full of new energy and vigour , they will , I hope , in making their plans for the winter's campaign , bear in mind that the war chest of the Union needs refilling . Like the widow's cruise of oil , it is getting dry , and it must be replenished speedily if the schemes for the winter's work are to be carried out I am very anxious to secure the remainder of the £ 2,000 before October 31 , so that we may start our new year on November 1st with a clean sheet and with new schemes for more special efforts " on behalf of the Union's funds . BERTHA MASON , Treasurer . September 25th . The list referred to in the above has been unavoidably held over . We hope to publish it next week . In the Border Burghs . Back again in Galashiels working up a society there , hold- ing cutdoor , and next week two indoor , meetings . Our first meeting was held on Wednesday evening at the " Salmon Corner , " where we had a huge and very attentive crowd , keenly interested in the speech and ready to buy " Common Causes , " postcards , and literature . Chalking the town earlier in the day , we discovered here as everywhere the same criticisms of methods and the usual attentions from the small boy . Pavements seem to grow small boys when one is doing Suffrage work . A meeting was announced for Thursday evening , but on Thursday evening it rained and thundered , so there was no succeeding in getting several members for the Society , I went meeting .

314 THE COMMON down to hold a meeting , and found quite a big crowd again to speak to this time on the industrial side of the question . Miss Tod , a local member , who has helped me many times , could not come , and Miss Wood was not coming till Saturday to help , so I was chairman and speaker and literature seller rolled into one , and had a very successful meeting , its only incident being provided by a male listener , who told me repeatedly and heatedly that soldiers had no votes and were just as badly treated as we were . I wondered what the " women can't fight , so shouldn't vote " people would have said to him . Saturday morning was wet and misty , but we went to Selkirk in the afternoon as arranged , and passed Abbotsford Ferry and went along the lovely Tweed , where the bordering trees are fading into gold and russet . We found one dry sheltered piece of pavement at Selkirk Station , so the inevit- able chalk came into use , and then we climbed up to Selkirk's market - place and went exploring . Wet pavements - too wet to chalk - and no bellman , but Miss Tod assured us there was always a crowd on Saturday night , and we would get every- body . We went down to the B.W.T.A. District Congress , and got in in time to hear Mrs. Napier tell the women they must work for Women's Suffrage and ought to join an association . We talked to many delegates at the end , and several said they were coming to hear our meeting at 7.30 . We got a huge crowd whenever our waggonette appeared , and despite the curfew bell , which silenced me for five minutes , the crowd listened to an hour's speaking very attentively . There was one noisy man who was removed by sympathisers , and another who kept on ejaculating : " What's the use of talking about the House of Commons ? It's the House of Lords we've got to deal with . You're all wrong , it's the House of Lords , " and aroused the wrath of several sympathetic women , who silenced him . Two new members at the end , and Miss Wood did wonders in the way of collection , and she found the sym- pathetic men saying to the pondering and hesitating ones : Go on , gie the lassie a penny . ' Miss Tod , Miss Wood , and I came back to Galashiels late , feeling we had been very successful , and knowing that it showed clearly we could have a society soon in Selkirk as well as in Galashiels . HELEN FRASER . Yorkshire Organization . A few days prior to the public meeting at Driffield we waited upon Sir Luke White , member for the Buckrose division of Yorkshire , who stated we were at liberty to announce he was a supporter of our movement . There was a large company present at the meeting on the 14th ; the hall and gallery were full , several rows of people standing , and we got a very good hearing . Colonel Stoweley , in the chair , alluded to the purifying influence of women in politics , and after I had spoken , Mr. W. H. Jennings began by first announcing we had the support of Sir Luke White , and then went on to deal with the physical force argument ; when he finished he left it with not a suspicion of a leg upon which to stand . A resolution was put to the audience , and the chairman announced that the only dissentients were half- a - dozen irresponsible boys at the back of the gallery . The following Friday a drawing - room meeting was held at Mrs. Herbert Holmes ' , Ivy Bank . I was in the chair , Mrs. Overbury read a delightful paper , and Mr. Jennings spoke . Both Mrs. Overbury and he gave opportunities for interesting discussions , but alas ! the moment was propitious , and " he who hesitates is lost " ! The larger proportion of the guests were prospective members of a proposed Driffield branch of the N.U.W.S.S. , so I seized the opportunity ; discussion was waived , we proceeded to business , elected the officers and committee , and formed a society . On Monday , the 20th , Mrs. Haworth , Mrs. Hess , and Miss Hawkes held an invitation meeting at the Royal Crescent Hotel , Filey , at which Mr. Jennings and I were the speakers , and sufficient names were given in to form an N.U.W.S.S. branch at Filey . The room was full , with an overflow in the hall , and it is expected the Filey Women Suffrage Society will be formed within the next two or three weeks . On Friday and Saturday evenings Mrs. Earp and I held meetings at Rotherham in the College Square and Market- place . The audience was good in point of numbers , and listened attentively . Against the resolution put on Friday evening in College Square there was only one hand held up . As usual , the owner of that solitary hand , when asked to state why he was against Women's Suffrage , had no answer to give . Meetings to be held under the Yorkshire organisation after the holidays are now being planned . The area of the county is enormous , and as the winter season approaches when open- air meetings become more or less of an uncertainty , we shall want every available drawing - room that kindly friends will offer us . The most successful campaigns are those planned in advance . Time and money are important factors in our scheme . It is impossible for the organizer to remain long enough in one small town for drawing - rooms to be secured and invitations sent out sufficiently in advance to secure acceptances and a good audience at a time of the year when everyone has many social engagements . One hears so often , " we could have arranged a better meeting if we had been able to give people longer notice . " Will friends willing to give a drawing - room for the Yorkshire organisation send in their names and addresses to Miss Bateson , Robin Hood's Bay , near Whitby , during the month of October . She will gladly

A large campaign is proposed for Sheffield and neighbour hood , including Hathersage , Dore , and Rotherham , winding up with a big public meeting under the auspices of the Shef- field W.S.S. Halifax and Ripon , York and Bradford are also to be visited . Then , in the extreme north of the county there is the Cleveland constituency . We are hoping to organise a meeting at Yarm , and if possible form a loca ! branch in that part . Work in Howdenshire and Selby , indoor meetings at Beverley , Driffield , Filey , and Sleights , all come within the scheme . MARY FIELDEN . X Village Meetings in Cumberland . In July the Keswick Women's Suffrage Association organized a series of open - air meetings in the industrial towns of Cumberland ; this month ( September ) we have been turning our attention to the villages in the neighbourhood of Keswick . We have held meetings at Littletown , Stair , Rosthwaite , Grange , Threlkeld , and Braithwaite ; at each of them we carried our resolution : " That the enfranchisement of women is a reform urgently needed in the interest both of women themselves and of the community as a whole . " Reports of the meetings were published by all the local papers ; one paper gave the speeches in full . We took as our text , " What we want , and why we want it . " Our speakers were Miss Chubb ( Liverpool ) , Mr. J. R. Brooke ( London ; late secretary Christian Social Union ) , Lady Beatrice Kemp , Mr. Anthony Wilson , Mr. H. M. Jenkins , Mrs. Wynn - Williams , Mr. and Mrs. Frank Marshall , Miss Minna Rathbone , and myself - all , except the first two , members of our local association . Miss Chubb spent a week at the Bungalow , advertised last month in " The Common Cause , " and spoke for us at three meetings . Her speeches were greatly appreciated ; her sound argument , evident earnestness , and above all her moderation , appeal very strongly to a North Country audience . It would be im- possible not to treat the question seriously after listening to her . Mr. Brooke very generously gave us three evenings out of a short and much - needed holiday ; our only regret in con- nection with the meetings was that we could not provide larger audiences for so good a speaker . Two of the meetings at which he spoke were out of doors , and had to be held before dark ; a good many of the farmers were therefore un- able to come , as they were busy getting in their hay , and could not spare an hour of daylight . Those who did come had the pleasure of listening to two most eloquent and convincing speeches : one on the urgent necessity of the reform we are working for from the women's point of view , and one on its still greater urgency in the interest of the community as a whole . Mr. Brooke also took the chair for us at a moment's notice at the Grange meeting , which was an extra one held by special request . He and Mr. Frank Marshall took the Rosthwaite meeting by themselves , as I was prevented at the last moment from going . The success of the meetings was largely due to the local organizers , whose work is scarcely less valuable than that of the speakers - Mrs . Barnes in Newlands ( Littletown ) , Mrs. J. Bawden at Threlkeld , Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Wilson and Mr. G. Watson at Braithwaite , Mrs. Bell at Grange , and Miss Greta Ward , who distributed handbills in Borrowdale . If only people realised what a relief it is to the central organizer to have someone on the spot in outlying districts who will be responsible for local arrangements , I think more sym- pathisers would volunteer to help in this way . Our meeting at Stair was held in the Guest House of the Co - operative Holidays Association , by kind permission of the authorities and the guests . Last year when I asked for leave to hold an outdoor meeting in the Guest House grounds we were refused , and had to speak from the other side of the fence . We take the changed attitude of the authorities unis year as an omen that we are gaining ground , surely and steadily , by our peaceful propaganda . The Guest House audience proved a delightful one . Miss Chubb , who was the chief speaker on that occasion , dwelt particularly on the benefits to be derived from co - operation between men and women , a line of argument that appealed to the men and women assembled for a co - operative holiday . Councillor James Johnston , of Manchester , spoke from the audience in support of the resolution ; his experience as a colleague of Miss Ashton's had taught him the great value of women's work in co - operation with men on public bodies . His only quarrel with us was that we were not asking to get into Parliament ; he said we were so badly needed there ! We had some vigorous heckling from an Adult Suffragist in the audience , who would not accept Mr. Keir Hardie's or Mr. Snowden's figures . He detained me after the meeting was ended to continue the discussion , but a friendly voice said in my ear : " You can quite safely leave him to his wife ; she can deal with him . " It appeared he was the husband of a lady who had volunteered to sell literature for us . At Grange we also had some heckling from a masculine Anti - Suffragist ; a remark of his to the effect that Suffrage speakers always afforded him great entertainment led to a lively but amicable discussion between him and the chairman as to what he meant by " entertainment . " After involving the questioner in various contradictions , and extracting a denial that by " entertainment " he meant " mirth " or

" SEPTEMBER 30 , 1909 . THE COMMON amusement , " Mr. Brooke announced , amidst much laughter and applause : " Ladies and gentlemen , at last we have it ; this gentleman evidently means that listening to Suffrage speakers always affords him keen intellectual enjoyment , and I am sure you will all agree with him . " CATHERINE E. MARSHALL ( Hon . Organising Sec . Keswick W.S.A. ) . The National Women's Social and Political Union . 4 , Clement's Inn , Strand , W.C. The eight women who were arrested in connection with the disturbances at Bingley Hall during Mr. Asquith's meeting came before the magistrate on Wednesday , September 22 , and three of them were sentenced to hard labour , the sentences varying from one to four months . The remainder were given periods of imprisonment in the second division . On their arrival at Winson Green Prison the women made violent resistance to the carrying out of prison regulations , and destroyed prison property . They also refused all food , whereupon the prison commissioners , with the approval of the Home Secretary , instructed the medical officer to administer food by force , which was done by means of passing a tube through the mouth into the stomach ; one prisoner endured this treatment , which is said to be painful , nauseating , and dangerous . The rest are said then to have taken food without the application of force . The prison authorities have refused permission to either the leaders of the Union or their legal representative to visit the prisoners . The W.S.P.U. therefore propose to make the Albert Hall meeting on October 7 an indignation meeting . The Monday afternoon " At Homes " in the Queen's Hall will recommence on October 4 , and will continue throughout the winter , the Thursday evening gatherings in the St. James's Hall having already started . Mrs. Pankhurst sails for America on Tuesday , October 12 ; before her departure she will address three mass meetings : one in the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday evening , October 7 ; one in the Waverley Market , Edinburgh , on Saturday after- noon , at 4 o'clock ; and another in the Sun Hall , Liverpool , on Monday , at 8 p.m. Women's Freedom League . 1 , Robert Street , Adelphi . The aggregate number of hours we have waited outside the House of Commons was last Thursday 10,000 , and through the kindness of Mrs. Hylton Dale , the event was celebrated by a meeting and presentation of special badges . Her pretty reception - rooms were full to overflowing with 150 picketers , and it was perhaps lucky that the other hundred could not come . Most of us assembled before 7 o'clock at the Houses of Parliament and waited ( the police being most kind and for- bearing ) till we were carried off to Onslow Gardens in two brakes and three motor - cars ( these last being lent by Tennessee Lady Cook , and all the three chauffeurs being nephews of hers ) . Mrs. Hylton Dale took the chair , and Mrs. Despard addressed us , singling out Mrs. De Vismes ( the champion picketer ) , Mrs. Manson , Mrs. Richmond and her son , Mrs. Margaret Moore , and a few others for special com- mendation and thanks . The badges which she then presented bear the words , " Petition . It is the right of the subjects to petition the King , and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal . " Short speeches were made by Mrs. Henry Nevinson and other picketers , and as soon as the affair was over the required number again took their stand outside the House of Commons , and the picketing will continue till the end of the session . We hope our readers will come to our " At Home " at Portman Rooms on Wednesday , October 6 , at 3 o'clock , and they will then hear of interesting events past and to come . The Scottish University Women's Suffrage Union . Northern Campaign . I have had a busy week , as the distances are great , and the steamers by no means regular . This not only affects one's own ability to go from place to place , but means that posts are more uncertain , and halls have generally to be taken by wire . After leaving Thurso on September 1 , the next two days were spent in arranging , with the help of Miss Elizabeth Smith , M.A. , for a series of seven meetings in the principal towns and islands of Orkney and Shetland . In Scalloway , on September 19 , the Public Hall was filled with an attentive audience , and two girls of the district helped with the literature sales and the collection . I was fortunate in meeting an Edinburgh graduate , Mr. Campbell , M.A .; who undertook to advertise the Lerwick meeting of the

CAUSE . 315 following evening . There the hall was packed half an hour before the time of beginning , and all my literature was sold in a few minutes . The audience was most enthusiastic , and in spite of the attempt of a well - known local heckler to obscure the issue by moving an Adult Suffrage amendment , the resolution was carried . More than £ 2 was taken in collection . A local society , with Miss Jameson as secretary , had already been formed , and the members helped with the literature and collection . On the following day , Miss Leila McNeil - who organised several successful meetings here lately and I held an outdoor meeting at Kirkwall , and the following evening I spoke at Stromness . On Monday , September 20 , the Temperance Hall , Kirk- wall , was filled with an audience of three or four hundred . Sir Victor Horsley took the chair and made an effective speech in favour of Women's Franchise . Unfortunately , there is a tradition in Kirkwall - so I was told - that meetings are to be disturbed , and some dozen or twenty youths kept up a con- tinuous rattle throughout the meeting , which prevented those in the gallery from hearing . Mrs. James Cursiter , Miss Smith , M.A. , and the Misses McNeill helped to make the meeting a success . On Tuesday I had intended to go to Stronsay , but the sea and wind were so high that a six hours ' journey in a small steamer seemed out of the question . On Wednesday I went to another island , Sandy , and had a very good meeting . Dr. Park took the chair at five minutes ' notice , and told how he had been a convert since his debating society days at college . Three members joined and about 7s . worth of literature was bought . The following day , by the kindness of Mrs. Cursiter , a meeting of ladies was called at her house , and the Orcadian Women's Suffrage Association was formed , making a good beginning with twelve members . On Friday I came to another island , South Ronaldshay , and about three hundred people filled the hall of the one small village of the island , St. Mar- garet's Hope . They were a very responsive audience . On the 27th I speak at Helmsdale , 28th at Brora , 29th Golspie , 30th Dornoch , 1st October Cromarty ( Victoria Hall , 8 p.m. ) , 2nd Alness ( Town Hall , 8 p.m. ) . I should be grateful if any Suffragists in the neighbourhood could help with litera- ture at any of the meetings . CHRYSTAL MACMILLAN . Campaign in the South . On Tuesday we had a small afternoon meeting at Kirkcud- bright . On Wednesday we spoke at Castle Douglas . There was a very big crowd , but the meeting was rather spoilt by the children who rattled the cups and chains round the foun- tain , and thought it great fun to rush about just outside the crowd after they had been vigorously driven away from the fountain by our sympathisers . On Thursday we bicycled over to Girkcudbright , and had a fair meeting in spite of the rain . We took a hall in Castle Douglas for Friday evening . The audience began to assemble very early , and people had to be turned away from the door . Next morning a minister who has supported Women's Suffrage for forty years thanked us for our speeches , and expressed his satisfaction with the meeting , which he thought was a most encouraging one . FRANCES M. PARKER . Artists ' Suffrage League . Postcard Competition . The Artists ' Suffrage League offers a £ 2 prize for a design for a picture postcard , suitable as propaganda in furthering the cause of Women's Suffrage . The design should be drawn in black and white , and the size about 10 by 7 . The Artists ' League reserves the right to purchase any design not receiving the prize for 10s . , the prize design to become the property of the League .

The president , Mrs. Kendal , and vice - presidents of the A.F.L. are " At Home " on Friday , October 1 , in the Grand Hall of the Criterion from 3 to 5 , and request the pleasure of the presence of all members of the National Union and the London Society for Women's Suffrage . Miss Fanny Brough will be in the chair , and the speakers are Miss Margaret Halstan , Miss Ogston , Mrs. Arncliffe - Sennett , Miss Cristopher St. ohn , Mr. Malcolm Mitchell , Major - General Sir Alfred Turner , K.C.B. , and , it is hoped , Mr. Granville Barker . Miss Horniman's Theatre . A large audience collected on Monday night for the " triple bill , " which included the once - censured play by Mr. Bernard Shaw , " Press Cuttings , " as well as a very charming English version of one act from " The Fantasticks , " by Rostand , and a one - act play by Mr. Allan Monkhouse .

316 THE COMMON when it was played in London " privately " for the London Society for Women's Suffrage . Lest the cap of " Balsquith " or " Mitchener " should be forced on to the head of a reluc- tant Minister or General , these great people are now harmless " Bones " and " Johnson , " and the malicious little thrust at the exhibition of French clothes in Downing Street is omitted . as This week some of us laughed with a rather wry mouth at Mr. Shaw's quips , which only two months ago seemed so funny . When one remembers that women are at the present moment being tortured in prison by a Government whose only remedy for disorder is repression , one can scarcely laugh very heartily at " Shoot ' em down ! " or if the laugh is loud , it is bitter too . The rapid rate of reprisals between the Government and the Militants has so increased that the skit is not far enough removed from actuality to allow of its being enjoyed as mere skit . " L The audience on the first night was a much livelier one at Miss Horniman's theatre than it was in London , and we thought we detected a distinct tendency to " Cheers and Counter Cheers . " When the actors are more familiar with their parts the play will go rather more briskly , as it should . It is too long , especially in the scenes with the anti - Suffragettes ; one feels as if Mr. Shaw had thrown it off too hurriedly to carry out the cuts which witnessing a performance would at once have shown him to be necessary . Neither Miss Ada King nor Mr. Iden Payne were very successful with their accents , Irish and Cockney , but they were funny as representatives of the only real people in the play , and Mr. Bibby made a good many points from the Prime Minister's embarrassed futility . Reaping the Whirlwind " is constructed with the most perfect economy : it is a very delicate pleasure to reflect how amazingly much Mr. Monkhouse has contrived to put into a short one act . The play was greatly helped by excellent acting , much better than on its first production , and we came away with a very clear conception of the husband , so absorbed in his work that all else is in a state of suspension . He thinks he loves his wife , but he has no personality left for a human relation ; he thinks love is a thing to be set aside till he wants it ; it is to be there , waiting , when he has time to attend to it . The wife is a more difficult job , and Mr. Monkhouse has only sketched an idea of a woman who , lacking love , tries to grow it in vacuity and fails ; her experi- ment ends in a tragic mess . Mr. Stanley Drewitt's acting suggested to admiration the man whose whole will - power and concentration have gone into the development and prosecution of his idea , and who has none left for the rest of life . Hooliganism in Birmingham . The recent riots at Bingley Hall have given even constitu- tional Suffragists and anti - Suffragists an opportunity to be martyrs for the cause . Matters are becoming somewhat seri- ous in Birmingham . The crowd , never over friendly in the birthplace of Austen Chamberlain , has now come to con- sider any woman as fair game . The late secretary of the Birmingham Society , Miss L. R. Taylor , was attending a committee meeting at 10 , Easy Row , last Wednesday , in connection with a society that has nothing whatever to do with Suffrage . She left the meeting early in order to go to service at a church in Hill Street . At the door of the office she saw an enormous crowd collected standing more or less still in front of the building and gazing up at the lights of a tailor's shop on the first floor . There was no light in the office itself , as the Committee meeting was in a back room . Miss Taylor felt the restlessness of the crowd and noticed that they looked at her in a curious way , so she asked one of the men what was the matter . Immediately there came a cry from the back : " There's the Suffragette , " and the crowd gathered around her , and began to push and pull at her coat . Miss Taylor said quietly : " I don't know what you mean ; I am not a Suffragette , I am a Suffragist , and I am going to church . " She then walked on down Paradise Street . She kept perfectly calm and neither hurried nor paid any attention to the questions and shoves that members of the crowd gave . " If I had shown the slightest sign of fear , " she told me , " I am perfectly certain that they would have attacked me , but you can't attack a person who ignores you . " At the top of Hill Street a woman slipped up to her and said : " Oh , I hope you don't mind them , Miss . " Immediately the crowd made a rush and knocked over the woman and another equally innocent person who was passing with her bicycle . At last two policemen appeared on the scene . They reproached Miss Taylor with not having taken a ' bus or a tram , but she pointed out that in the first place there was not one to be seen , and in the second place she did not see why she as a peaceable citizen should not be allowed to go to church without being followed by a mob , and being obliged to take a tram to some place to which she did not wish to go . She was finally escorted down Hill Street between two police- men , followed by the pushing crowd . The rumour spread to all her friends that she had been arrested , and at one Girls ' Club where she is known a woman rushed in crying bitterly , " Oh , Miss Taylor's been arrested . " The police escorted her right up to the gates of the church , and it was exceedingly funny , said Miss Taylor , whose sense of humour is of the keenest , to see the expression of the crowd as she walked quietly into the church while the police guarded the entrance .

CAUSE . SEPTEMBER 30 , 1909 . One man was overheard to say , " I guess we've made a mistake this time . " It was very amusing , but it might have been very serious . " A far worse case has also been reported to me . The gardener of one of our members was going home down Bridge Street , a rather poor quarter , when he saw a woman set upon by some men . You're a Suffragette , are you ? " they shouted . " We'll strip you and see if we can't make you ashamed . " They began to tear her clothes off . The poor girl was pleading with them , but it was impossible to hear what she said above the din , and there is no doubt , I am told , that if some men had not gone to her rescue she would have been stripped naked . These are not isolated cases ; several more have been men- tioned to me . It is now enough for a little boy in the street to call out " Suffragette " for a woman to run the risk of assault . It may be that Birmingham is particularly retrograde , I rather think that it is , and I would take as a sign the fact that it is here that the militants have received the heaviest sentences , and that the authorities are resorting to artificial feeding for the women . There is no doubt that the action at Bingley Hall has meant a great setback for the cause in Birmingham , and that it has made our work increasingly diffi- cult . If it is also to mean that innocent women are to be insulted at will , we shall have additional reason to regret it . E. M. G. The Compleat Organizer . XI . - BY - ELECTIONS ( 2 ) COMMITTEE ROOM . This series is being written by a number of different people in the hope of making it as " compleat " as possible . Obviously , different organizers must have different methods and dodges , and we shall welcome the fruits of experience of any practical writer . Our last article left the Committee Room cleaned , warmed , and lighted ; now the organizer must dress it . In the first place she will require some sort of sloping shelf inside the window for the display of literature , postcards , badges , etc. If there is nothing of the sort there already a carpenter will , for a few shillings , fix up something quite serviceable . For- give the obvious , but - demand an estimate ! She will now need five or six dozen drawing - pins , three or four rolls of music - mender ( gummed tape ) , red and black ink , pins and paint - brushes , large sheets of paper ( lining paper is good ) , large sheets of white cardboard , blotting paper , pins and scissors , and she will probably find it necessary to borrow a pair of steps . For several reasons it is best to begin by filling the windows ( all but the lower part which commands our display of literature ) with Artists ' League posters . This gives the public ( who will already be swarming outside the window ) something to look at , and it gives a shade more privacy to the suffragists inside . The music - mender will attach the posters for the most part , though the heavier ones will need a few drawing - pins - where there is anything to stick them into ! At the same time she must paint ( with ink ) and stick up in a prominent position the name of our society and president , adding Constitutional and Non - party . " This is merely a temporary expedient , for she must at once order a large painted or printed notice to fit either along the place where the name of the owner should go , across the top pane of the window , or anywhere else conspicuous . It may either be on paper , pasted on , or on canvas or calico , when it will serve again . The present writer has generally found it best to go to a sign - painter , who is often very moderate and is not , as a rule , so terribly over - worked as the printer . To return to the room . The organiser can now cover her walls with posters , and it is amazing how the whole place is transformed , especially when she has hired some furniture- a table and a few chairs . She has probably begun to unpack her literature , to put samples in the window , and now she had better proceed with that and carefully pack away and neatly arrange all that she is not at present using . Methodical arrangement and neatness are all - important , though some- times incredibly difficult in the very limited space at her disposal . She should have made every effort to secure helpers , for most of this work needs no special experience , but can be done by anyone willing and handy . They should make as good a show as possible with the colours ( at by - elections red is generally a party colour , so we have to add a third to our colours : green we have found effective ) . In this way they will dispose of a good many yards of cheap stuff and ribbon . Then let them paint on the sheets of cardboard , and put out , some encouraging notices such as " Please walk in , " " Enquiries invited , " etc. 55 On the table ( which should be covered with brown paper ) the organiser must set ink , pens , and blotting - paper . It is worth while to get safety ink - pots , which cost only one penny each , and fill them from a bottle . If the petition sheets have arrived they also should be spread out , and notices displayed inviting electors to come in and sign . As to the future of the Committee Room - it should never be deserted . One person must have absolute authority therein and be herself responsible for finding a substitute when she has to leave it . It will then be a rendezvous for all the workers , our sympathisers will come there , newspaper

SEPTEMBER 30 , 1909 . THE COMMON reporters will come , so will party agents , as well as a curious succession of cranks , from the man who can prove that the world is flat to the exponents of unique religious creeds , each wanting us to run his special scheme and call it Women's Suffrage . Here all correspondence will come and those perpetual telegrams which flutter , like orange birds , over an election . Here , too , the correspondence must be dealt with and a messenger always at hand is invaluable - essential , indeed , if the Committee Room is left in charge of one person . Whoever is in charge should make a point of setting aside and pigeon - holing all work which can be done by voluntary helpers , so that she may never reject proffered assistance nor ever cool the ardour of young enthusiasts for work by having them kicking their heels . Almost equally important is the Committee Room in its character of shop . In some elections we have done a roaring trade ; in all we have disseminated quantities of literature and seen our badges adorning caps , coats , and blouses on " Careful accounts " every hand . is the one warning here . one person be responsible and all others account to her . With the petition to be signed , too ( of which more anon ) , the committee - room - keeper will probably have her own , and her helpers ' , hands full . Chief amongst her trials will be small boys and drunken men . How to deal with these must be left to the genius of the individual . One hint , however , as to the boys . It has been found a splendid plan , on the principle of " set a thief to catch a thief , " to make friends with certain biggish ones , who will then control the others as no one else could . They quite take possession of one - defend one's reputation against all onslaughts and are most faithful companions and assistants . Occosionally they are over - jealous , as when an organiser found that two who had been helping her had , whilst her back was turned , packed up in neat brown paper parcels tied with string all her carefully assorted literature : and some of the sweets which have to be accepted are a sore trial of friendship . But , in spite of minor drawbacks , a nice small boy is a real help and pleasure . Girls are generally shyer , and the present writer must , as a suffragist , record that the most efficient and wholly satisfactory helper that she ever had was a little girl . Sometimes one has a Committee Room large enough to hold meetings in , but such meetings are in many ways difficult to manage . It is hard not to let too many people crowd in , and the ventilation is very seldom adequate . The posters and notices have been known to fall from the windows as the gum melted in the steaming heat . But the question of meetings will be fully dealt with in another article by another writer . We will leave the com- mittee room with a final exhortation to its guardian for neatness , order , calm , and such a fine adjustment of work that there is never a slack time and never a rush . This- everyone will admit - is a counsel of perfection . Foreign News . UNITED STATES . In the death , on September 7 , of the veteran Henry B. Blackwell , the women's cause in America loses a staunch and life - long supporter and one to whom the movement owes many of its successes . In 1853 he made his first speech for Woman Suffrage at a great convention in Cleveland , Ohio , and two years later he met and fell in love with Lucy Stone , at that time the best - known advocate of woman's rights in the country . He had a long and arduous courtship , for Lucy had made up her mind not to marry , meaning to devote herself wholly to the work for equal rights . But he promised to devote himself to the same work , and persuaded her that together they could do more for it than she could do alone . He kept the promise loyally , not only during the 38 years of their married life , but during the 16 years since his wife's death . They were married in 1855 , and on this occasion they published a joint protest against the inequalities of the marriage laws , which makes very curious and interesting reading . It attracted wide attention , and helped to get the laws amended . During the first part of his life he was a comparatively poor man , and had to give most of his time to business . After 1870 , having acquired a competence , he was free to devote himself to reform . He was the unpaid secretary of the American Woman Suffrage Association for 20 years , of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association for 30 years , and of the new England Woman Suffrage Association from its organisation in 1868 to the time of his death . When the " Woman's Journal " was started in Boston in 1870 , with Mrs. Livermore as editor - in - chief , Mr. Blackwell and his wife , with Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and Col. Higginson , were on the editorial staff . Two years later , Mrs. Livermore , whose time was under increasing demand in the lecture field , resigned the editorship , and Mr. Blackwell and his wife ( who had raised most of the money to start the paper originally ) took it up . He and his daughter were carrying it on at the time of his death .

Book Reviews . The " THE SCORE , " BY LUCAS MALET . Lucas Malet's last volume consists of two stories . second , " Her Convictions , " dealing with the loves of a rising politician and an actress a good deal his senior , is the better of the two , but is spoilt by tiresome mannerisms of style . " Miserer Nobis " is sensational and unreal , and the setting of a last confession in which it is told does not carry convic- tion . The book is hardly worthy of the author's reputation . J. B. O'M .

They make very handsome books , and the sterling quality of the articles will make many people wish to add them to their permanent library . Dr. Newton H. Marshall writes on " Empires and Races " in the September Contemporary Review describing the present era as one of growing racial contact and national fusion , or reduction , pitted against a still persisting racial cleavage and repugnance . We want social reform and international peace , but are forced to maintain an Empire by armaments . Miss Gilbert E. Jones writes in the North American Review for August on " Some Impediments to Woman Suffrage . " She advances all the usual anti - suffrage arguments , and declares in addition that woman suffrage in Utah , Wyoming , Idaho , and Colorado has proved utterly futile . This magazine also contains a highly interesting and suggestive article on " Domestic Science in the Schools and Colleges , " by Helen Sayr Gray , who lays great stress upon the necessity of the study , and the physical evils induced by ignorance of it . In the Westminster Review for September is an article entitled " The Girl and the Vote , " by a girl , H. Graham Turnbull , which gives a very interesting account of the sudden awakening of the younger generation of women to the possibilities which lie before them . The writer is sure that if a plebiscite were taken an overwhelming majority of girls and young women would declare for their enfranchisement . The same issue contains an essay on " Racial Suicide , " by G. B. Lissenden , couched in the form of a reply from the masses to the charge that their deliberately limited birth- rate is bringing about the downfall of the nation . The reply is that improvement in social conditions must produce a race less in numbers but infinitely greater in efficiency . on In the National Review for September Mrs. Harris writes " The Craze for Nursing Homes , " pointing out that in the case of the well - to - do nursing in their own homes would frequently be far more beneficial , and that the fashion of nursing homes has been instituted by doctors , either because they are financially interested in such homes , or because they prefer the absolute control which is possible in an institution . Sidney Low's article on " Darwinism and Politics , " in the September Fortnightly Review dwells on the fact that our present political generation has been born into the scientific era , and that the culture of our party leaders is no longer mainly literary . He prophesies a future " sociocratic " state , which would confer benefits in strict proportion to merit , but would insist on equality of opportunity as the means of determining the degree of merit .

WOMEN AT THE LIBERAL MEETING , BINGLEY HALL . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , At a committee meeting on Monday morning the following resolution , which I am directed to send to you , was passed : - " That this committee protests against the incorrect and contemptuous reference in the " Common Cause " of Sept. 23 to the ' sundry Liberal women ' who attended the Bingley Hall meeting , knowing that their President and others claimed admission for the whole Executive of the Women's Liberal Association , as a protest against the general exclusion

318 THE COMMON of women from that meeting , and obtained this right without signing any humiliating conditions . " - Yours on behalf of the Committee , EM . GARDNER ( Chairman pro tem . ) . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , May I put you in possession of the actual facts with regard to all the Birmingham Liberal women who attended the Bingley Hall Budget meeting . They really do not deserve the hard things that you say about them in your paragraph , " Domesticity in Politics , " in last week's issue of " Common Cause . " As a matter of fact , they made a very effective protest for the cause of Women's Suffrage , for they demanded to be admitted to the The words used meeting in their own right as women . were : Our claim is made in our own right , and not as the relatives of a male worker . " The claim was allowed , and the women were all admitted without signing any humiliat- ing pledge of good behaviour . The most they were asked to do was to sign their names in a book to prevent impersona- tion ( but women who went to Mr. Balfour's meeting had to do the same ) , and one - the President - refused to do that , saying she would not do one single thing that a man had not had to do . Moreover , in the hall , sitting in the front row , they did not applaud nor stand up when the whole room stood to greet Mr. Asquith . This claim to be admitted was made some time before there was any question of the protest meeting , and though entirely in sympathy with our meeting , the women who had made and carried their claim thought it best to attend the meeting , which they did in triumph ; not at all " on a leash , " but manifesting their absolute right to be present as women . Some people think they did wrong ,, and say that as they did not procure the right to be present for all women , but only their particular association , that they ought not to have been present at all . The same people think that if it was proposed to enfranchise twenty women those twenty ought not to accept it . Others think that the fact of the breaking down of the exclusion of women on the grounds of sex alone would be a tremendous gain , and that therefore This the protest made by these women was an effective one . is all a matter of opinion ; but in no way did these women deserve the taunting remarks made in your article , and many of us felt strongly about it . I am sure when you know the facts you will agree with me that your condemnation L. R. TAYLOR . was altogether undeserved . [ We regret that the paragraph in question should have given offence , and we apologise that it should have been written at all . It was done under misapprehension of the circumstances , caused by reports both in the press and private , that the only women to be admitted would be rela- tions of men concerned in getting up the meeting and well- known Liberal workers , who would consent to sign a pledge not to disturb the meeting . It appears that these conditions were relaxed under pressure , and we are very glad indeed to hear that some women , at least , and they Suffragists , refused to enter into recognisances . - ED . " C.C. " ] VIOLENCE AND REACTION . M. Clark , 3 , Havelock Terrace , Sunderland , writes , in reply to " One of the Old Guard , " that in her opinion militant tactics would not have been necessary had women Liberals all over the country taken up a strong and definite position towards Women's Suffrage . She states that she was herself a delegate to the Federation meetings in May last , and , with others , was intensely disappointed at Lady Carlisle's advice ; had they been otherwise led , she believes every woman would have risen to the occasion , and the greatest blow would have been struck at militant tactics . She regards a large number of women Liberals as " party mad , " and largely responsible for the extreme action of those who wish to see something done at last . She points out that even if Mr. Asquith is all our correspondent claims him to be , " he does not believe in Women's Suffrage , and it is very rarely one can hope for sympathy where there is no belief . " FAIR PAPERS . For To the Editor " Common Cause . " Madam , I have been much interested in the article , Putting the Clock Back , " in your current number , par- ticularly in respect of the attitude of the press towards the Suffrage Movement . May I recommend to your readers four papers which treat us with fairness . First and foremost , the " Queen " and the " Morning Post . " These two journals have frequently reports of Suffrage meetings , and the first- named excellent articles on the woman's question . dwellers on the South Coast , the " Sussex Daily News " merits support . It publishes reports of our meetings , and in any correspondence about Female Suffrage , letters bear- ing on both sides are inserted with impartiality . I should also like to say a good word for the " Daily Mirror , " which is very fair in its correspondence column . It has now and again reports , more or less favourable , it is true , on Suffrage subjects , but , according to my experience , usually just and never offensive . Of course , it is to be hoped that all Suffragists take in one or other of the special organs of their cause , but as far as the ordinary daily papers or weekly magazines they patronise are concerned , they should sup- port those which are just towards them in preference of those which are not . - Yours , A CONSTITUTIONAL SUFFRAGIST :

" During the process of manufacture of Veno's Lightning Cough Cure , significant discoveries have just come to light whereby the curative value of the remedy is considrably enhanced , consequent on improvements in the method of admixture .

SEPTEMBER 30 , 1909 . BIRMINGHAM . THE COMMON We have this week been trying to devise means for pushing " The Common Cause . " It becomes more and more obvious that , as the Press ignores us , we must push our own Press . It is only through " The Common Cause " that constitutional methods and principles can be made known . We must therefore have a large circulation . I want to see that it is 500 in Birmingham before the end of the year . On Friday we did an excellent sale outside Miss Pankhurst's meeting , and we mean to go to the theatre queues two or the times a week during the winter . Those who will help in this way , and it is not at all unpleasant , are asked to send their names to 10 , Easy Row , as soon as possible . NOTTINGHAM . A most successful outdoor meeting was held in the Market Place , Newark , Notts . , on Friday evening . Miss Princep had spent several days in the division , calling on the people and getting the subject talked about . We had a huge crowd and got , on the whole , an excellent hearing , though in the middle the rowdy element threatened for a time to get the upper hand . A handy policemen banged two or three of the noisiest heads together , and we got control again and held it till we had to go for our train , selling many " Common Causes on the way . Miss Royden again spoke for us , and a large number of people of all classes listened with intense interest to everything that was said . One girl pushed her way through the crowd to the lorry and would not let us go for our train till we had her name and address , she was so anxious to join our " league , " and I believe and hope we shall start a branch society at Newark before very long . The first of the monthly " At Homes " ( which were so successful last winter ) was held on Thursday , September 23rd , at Calvert's Café . There were about fifty present ( members and others ) . Lady Onslow was in the chair , and in her opening address she referred to some of the effects of women's suffrage in Australia . She spoke from the point of view of one who had exercised the vote in a country where the women's vote is valued by all parties . Miss Maude Royden followed with an able exposition of the by - election policy of the N.U. which was very convincing to those members who have never worked at a by - election ; those who have do not need convincing . The Hon . Secretary , Mrs. H. B. Dowson , concluded with a few words outlining the programme of events for the coming winter . CHELTENHAM . The fourth village meeting was held at Churchdown on September 24th , at 2.30 . In spite of a heavy shower at noon the place was pretty well canvassed with leaflets , and another downpour finally cleared the air , so that shortly after the time announced it was possible to begin speaking . Scarcely anyone was about , but a plea of " Give us a bit , miss ; let's have a short address , " from a number of men inside " The Old Elm " decided the organiser to go on . Several persons showed a friendly interest , helping with the arrange- ments for the meeting and promising future assistance .

Through the energy and initiative of Mrs. Alfred Hutchinson , who made all the arrangements , new ground was broken at Castleton on September 21st , when Mr. W.

Barnsley , Alfred Hutchinson , M.A. , B.Sc. , and others . The speakers were Miss F. Nelson Pringle and Mr. Ewart Richardson . This , the first suffrage meeting held in Castleton , aroused great interest in the district .

Castleton needs more meetings , that the interest and sympathy shown may be deepened and gathered up . Many " Common Causes " and pamphlets were bought . CUMBERLAND - KESWICK . Fourteen women householders , members of the Association , sent in claims to have their names placed in the Parliamentary register . The number would have been much larger if there had been more time to organise . The Revision Court was held on September 22nd . Miss C. E. Marshall , Hon . Organizing Secretary , appeared as Agent " for the women claimants . The Revising Barrister courteously allowed her to state the grounds on which the claim was made , and replied at length , giving , at her request , the legal grounds on which the exclusion of duly qualified women is justified . The question was treated seriously throughout . The claimants were given seats on the magistrates ' bench , and Miss Marshall was invited to take her place between the Conservative and Liberal agents - beautifully typical of our non - party attitude ! The Revising Barrister complimented the claimants on the " dignity and ability with which the claim had been preferred and supported . The local papers have all commented favourably on the proceedings , and most of them , including the " Carlisle Journal , " have reported the speeches of Miss Marshall and the Revising Barrister verbatim .
