Will some hundreds of them volunteer to sell our paper on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , and Saturday next week ( July 23rd , 24th , 25th , and 26th ) ? Some of the pilgrims have volunteered to sell , and we accept their services with the more gratitude that we know they will arrive here tired . But there must be many to whom it has been absolutely impossible to join in the march . I ask them to remember that all of us who could not be pilgrims have got to ransom ourselves somehow ! We are sending all the money we can scrape together , of course , but here is a chance to give personal service too . There ought to be a large army of sellers , especially on the final day . Papers must not be sold in Hyde Park , unfortunately , but if sellers arm them- selves with large bags they can stow away the unsold copies at the last moment . And we will , if possible , arrange for a car or cart to stand near the entrance to the Park , to receive papers from those who are unable to reach it . We know , of course , that to sell papers may mean some sacrifice on the part of the sellers , but we are confident that we shall not appeal for that sacrifice in vain . Will all members of the National Union remember that other Suffrage papers will be sold along the route , and that anyone who buys a militant paper and reads it will become completely confused as to the character of our demonstration . It is useless to write " Law - Abiding " on ou banners , and leave the crowd under the impression that a militant newspaper is our organ . Nothing could confuse the public mind more hopelessly . Will you all see to it that it is THE COMMON CAUSE that floods London next week ? Motors and Carts Wanted . Will some of our friends please lend us motors or carts in order to supply the sellers with papers as fast as they sell out ? They will certainly sell out fast , and we want to ensure their wasting no precious time . Also , the supply of vehicles will be a magnificent advertisement , with the colours and posters on them . One carriage has been promised already . How many more ?

No. 223 . LAW - ABIDING . Cause National Union of SUFFRAGE . 18 , 1913 . Notes and Price One Penny . and Comments . Women and Government Wages . Suffragists will watch with intense interest the development of affairs in the Pimlico Clothing Factory . It appears that the women working on the scarlet clothing were offered an extra penny on to their rates , only to find that the rates on the drab clothing were at the same time to be reduced twopence . As the scarlet work is temporary and the drab permanent , the state of the case was even worse than appears at first sight , and the workers at once struck and asked to be received by Colonel Seely . As he consented to meet a deputation the women have at present gone back to work , and the matter is under consideration . As it has recently been so openly stated that the Suffrage agitation is a great spur to the interest of politicians in women's questions , Suffragists are under a peculiar responsibility to watch the course of such disputes as these . Women and the Insurance Act . The impressive memorial issued by the Women's Co- operative Guild , and signed by Miss Llewellyn Davies and Miss Bondfield , with regard to the Insurance Act , must surely influence discussion in the House of Commons . It is conciliatory in tone and sane in its demands , recognising and emphasising the fact that the maternity benefit has been " the most needed and the most popular part " of the Act ; but it urges very strongly the amendments " unanimously passed " by the great Guild . These are , briefly , the payment of the benefit to the mother ; the removal of the clause providing that if a doctor is called in by a midwife , his fee , to an amount prescribed by the Commissioners , should be paid out of the maternity benefit ; and the payment of ordinary sick - pay to insured married women , as well as maternity benefit . With regard to these , the memorial points out that the Act certainly intended the last and provided for it . The second has worked exceedingly badly in practice . The first is the most important of all . Who is the " Insured Person " ? Defenders of the Act have argued that the father should receive the maternity benefit because he is the insured person . They forget , we think , that the married working - woman is quite as important an economic factor in the home as her husband . If she were to do , in someone else's house , what she does in her own , she would receive wages for it , and out of those wages could pay her own insurance . If she works in her own home instead ( and so forfeits the right to be insured herself ) , she is not less a wage - earner , though she is seldom a wage - receiver . It ought to be recognised , as the Co - operative Guild insists , that " the fourpence paid by the man has been contributed equally by the woman through her hard work in the home . " In other words , a woman should not be penalised for choosing work at home rather than work in a factory !

JULY 18 , 1913 . " THE COMMON aim of encouraging Liberal Women to put suffrage before party , ' but in the belief that the principles underlying the demand for Women Suffrage , and those on which Liberalism itself is Any association of Liberal based , are one and the same . Women which approves the object of the Union , and gives an undertaking not to work officially for an Anti - Suffrage candidate , is eligible for affiliation ; and any Liberal woman who is prepared to sign a pledge not to work for an Anti - Suffrage candidate is eligible for membership . This is a very important development , which should have far - reaching effects on the Liberal Party . We have pleasure in publishing particulars under " News of Other Societies , " page 262 . Results of the General Strike in Belgium . The strike in favour of Manhood Suffrage which took place recently in Belgium has left the question of Women's Suffrage in an extraordinary position . It appears that the Socialist Party has Women's Suffrage on its official programme , but was prepared to ( and did ) allow this fact to drop out of sight , in order to work with the Liberal Party for Manhood Suffrage . After the strike , as is generally known , a Commission was appointed to inquire into the question of electoral reform , and this Commission was composed of men from all three parties— Liberal , Socialist , and Catholic . The two former , of course , demanded Manhood Suffrage . The Catholics , however , who . have always been violently opposed to any extension of the Suffrage at all , now boldly announce that they will only consent to Manhood Suffrage if Womanhood Suffrage is granted too ! The Socialists can hardly resist the demand for a measure which is part of their own official programme , however willing they may have been to ignore it . What will happen ? The women do not know . All they know is that ( in the words of Mrs. Chapman Catt ) " no two things in Nature are more alike than one politician is like another politician ; especially when he is engaged in looking for an excuse not to do to - day what he knows he must do to - morrow . " Distinction for Miss Clementina Black . We congratulate Miss Black - and , still more , the Govern- ment on its recognition of her distinguished services . The only woman to whom a Civil List Pension has been granted this year on account of her own contributions to the service of humanity , is best known to the public through her work for social reform in women's industries . There is , however , a not inconsiderable group in London who have been influenced by her literary work and criticism . Her efforts for social regenera- tion may , notwithstanding , be considered her life's work . Many of these activities are already bearing fruit , but so quickly do we live to - day that the beginnings of movements she initiated are almost forgotten . As one of the founders of the Women's Trade Union Association , for example , she helped to sow the seed which has resulted in the work of investigation and inquiry so vigorously carried out by the Women's Industrial Council , of which she is still the President . The chief strength of Miss Black's reforming zeal has , however , been concentrated against the sweating system . She was one of the organising Committee for the arrangement of the Anti - Sweating Exhibition of 1906 , and was a Founder and is a Vice - President of the Anti - Sweating League ; she has also given evidence on this and other industrial problems before the Royal Commission on Labour , the Royal Commission on the Sweating System , the Select Committee on Home Work , and the Departmental Committee on Truck Acts . Amongst her many contributions to the literature of social reform , perhaps none have had a greater influence than Sweated Industry and the Minimum Wage and Makers of Our Clothes . The Baden Powell Girl - Guides . " Some three hundred and fifty Baden Powell Girl - Guides were seen lining the route " by which their Majesties drove through Liverpool last Saturday . We believe this is the second time they have been so privileged , the first time being at Crewe a few months ago . The Boy - Scouts have frequently " lined the route , " but it is something new for the Girl - Guides , and we hope that this recognition may be of great help to a splendid organisa- tion , which only needs to be known to spread as rapidly among girls as the earlier organisation has among boys . A police constable of thirty - six years ' standing told one of , their officers in Liverpool that he had never seen anything to surpass the smartness of the girls ' drill and marching order , and everyone who was in any way responsible for their appearance is feeling exceedingly proud .

Opinions expressed upon other subjects must not be regarded as necessarily those of the Union . The World's Pilgrims ' Progress . By this time , those who are on pilgrimage have reached an audience which must be piling up to hundreds of thousands . No effort made by the Union in the past has ever justified itself more triumphantly . We are reminded by this new Pilgrim's Progress that we are fellow - workers with the past and with the future . The world itself is on the road , and our march is only part of all the marches of all great causes which move onwards and upwards . For all of us , pilgrims of yesterday , to - day and to- morrow , there is only one enemy - the spirit of cruelty and injustice ; only one aim - the renewal of justice and peace . This is true of all great reforms , and this makes us Suffragists the fellow workers of all who have fought against slavery , against legalised impurity , against the exploiting of subject- races , or of little children . We claim kinship with Wilberforce , with Lord Shaftesbury , with Mrs. Butler , and Elizabeth Fry . They were pilgrims , as we are , and to the same shrine . At different hours in human history progress takes different forms ; but its spirit is always the same . It is not really slavery , or child - labour , or the subjection of women against which we strive ; but against the spirit which makes these things possible . It is the wish to enslave that is our enemy ; the desire to dominate the lives of other people ; the brutal determination to have in one's power to be unjust . The Pilgrims ' Progress of humanity is the gradual yielding of the belief that might is right , before the knowledge that right is might . Men and women rise in the scale of being in proportion as they find in the justice of any claim made upon them , a compulsion which they cannot resist . There are many people who are in the strictest sense incapable " of an unjust or cruel act towards the weakest person . Most of us would be insulted if we were congratulated on our refusal to think might right in our private lives . should boast - if it occurred to us to boast about the matter - not that we did not , but that we could not act on such a principle . The moral compulsion is a real compelling , and what people still pretend to regard as an impracticable vision , is in fact the ordinary rule of life to ordinary people . " We All real progress is the growth of this spirit . Black slavery and white slavery and all such horrors are only symptoms ; selfishness and brutality are the disease . It is in this spirit that the National Union attacks the question of Women's Suffrage . And it is , therefore , not surprising that some who are still outside our movement should object - with more justice than Suffragists are always willing to perceive - that what we want is " not more voters , but better voters ; not better laws , but better men . " We have all met the Anti - Suffragist who frankly despises women , and desires to " keep them in their place , " and to decide what that place is . But we know also the Anti - Suffragist - often a woman - who is so conscious that the real enemy is selfishness and cruelty , that she is made impatient by what seems to her a futile attack on mere externals . Why vex yourselves , " says such a critic , about votes ? Set your- selves , as women , to the making of better men , and you are working for the only real progress humanity can make . " " To such fine spirits as these , we Suffragists are so closely bound that we urge on them once more to consider their position 33 and ours . Is there any way of making better men than to urge the doing of better deeds ? At all points in human history

JULY 18 , 1913 . July 9th . In Parliament . THE COMMON Lord Henry Cavendish - Bentinck asked what the Home Secretary proposed to do to remedy the hardships inflicted on women factory - workers by unjust fines , as reported by the Chief Lady Inspector . Mr. McKenna hopes to deal with the question in the near future , but is " not in a position to make any statement . " Mr. Chapple asked the Prime Minister " whether his atten- tion had been called to a case in the Police Court , under the White Slave Act , in which a woman dressed in a nurse's uniform was concerned ; and whether , in view of the growing frequency of the abuse , he will , pending the enfranchisement of women , take any steps , by legislation or otherwise , to protect the nursing profession in this respect . " Mr. McKenna replied that the matter presented very serious difficulties , but was receiving attention . Mr. O'Grady asked if , the " Cat - and - Mouse " Bill " having failed in its object , " any further legislation would be introduced ? Mr. McKenna denied that it had failed . Lord Wolmer asked whether facilities would be granted for the passage of the Legal Profession ( Admission of Women ) Bill ? The Prime Minister answered in the negative . July 10th . The Prime Minister , in answer to a question , said that the Education Bill would probably be introduced next week . Mr. Hunt asked whether , in view of the fact that a letter posted on July 3rd , and addressed to Miss Christabel Pankhurst , had not been received , the officials at the Post Offices had had instructions to intercept and open letters addressed to prominent Suffragettes ? Mr. Herbert Samuel replied in the negative . Lord H. Cavendish - Bentinck called attention to the fact that boys of 15 in tinplate works are carrying weights of from 90 to 100 lbs . , and women and girls in other industries , from So to 100 lbs . The Home Secretary could not say when the matter could be taken up . Asked what steps he proposed to take in regard to a manager of a factory having been fined 1d . for illegal employment of a girl of 14 without certificate of fitness , Mr. McKenna admitted the facts , but did not propose to take any steps . July 11th and 12th . << PLURAL VOTING BILL . - The debate on the Plural Voting Bill repeated itself ad nauseam on the different clauses , and listeners must have had some sympathy with the nameless member whose only contribution to the debate " was one at once declared unparliamentary by the Deputy- " Rot ! " Speaker - namely , a despairing cry of One point of interest to Suffragists was the fact that not only was the " argument from physical force " conspicuous by its absence , but a special plea was put in for the University franchise ( threatened but not destroyed by the Bill ) on the grounds that University seats offered a chance to learned gentle- men " of retiring disposition , " to avoid " the racket of an election . " Mr. Asquith's speech at the close of the debate is worth remembering . He said : " In any democratic country one ought to count for one for all purposes of election and represen- tation . Every citizen who qualified for the franchise ought to be on the same footing as every other citizen . " He upheld the Bill on the ground that without it , 500,000 electors obtained an unjustifiable advantage over their 8,000,000 fellow - electors ; and that the House of Commons ought to be as accurate a reflection as possible of the mind of the people . July 15th . MENTAL DEFICIENCY BILL . ( Report stage . ) - A clause , added in Committee , makes the putative father liable to main- tain a defective illegitimate child up to the age of twenty - one . Another applies the Criminal Law Amendment Act to defective women and girls in the same manner as to girls under sixteen , " if the accused knew or had reason to suspect " that the victim was deficient . In this form the protection offered by the law will probably be absolutely worthless . July 16th . 33 INSURANCE ACT AMENDMENT BILL . ( Second reading . ) - Mr . Hodge urged the legalisation of married women as direct recipients of the maternity benefit . We regret the suggestion that the approved society " may pay it to the mother , and strongly urge that this much desired amendment should , when it is put forward , run not may " but " must . " The position of casual labourers as affected by the Bill will be very largely a woman's question . At present it is not at all clear what exactly is proposed . The second reading was carried without a division ,

CAUSE . Pilgrimages Old and New . 249 Day by day news comes to us from all parts of the country of the Women's Pilgrimage , which , by the force of its gathering strength and extending influence is awakening the intellectual sluggards of the British Isles . " What then is this Women's Pilgrimage ? " some enquire , and what its relationship to modern life ? Pilgrimages belong to the ritual of the past , and their artificial revival is a mockery of the progress of civilisation . But such are the ways of women . " " The ways of women are , however , not to be so easily dismissed . Those of us who work at the heart of the woman's movement , and have had , perchance , some vision of this vaunted modern civilisation , may well reply : " This pilgrimage of ours is no vain show ; no gaudy spectacle devised behind the scenes for the capture of the goodwill of an unthinking mob and a hide - bound Ministry , but a spontaneous efflorescence , the expression of the spirit of our times . " can see Those of us who share the knowledge of our critics con- cerning pilgrimages of yore , may , too , glance back over the centuries , and hear again the tramp of 20,000 pilgrims as they march to Bubastes , to worship at Egypt's ancient shrine ; we can see , too , dimly , the procession of dusky figures wending their way through Eastern scenes until their weary bodies are refreshed by sight of India's sacred stream ; we again other July days in this our country , when the sweet- scented hedgerows cheered the hundred thousand pilgrims on their march to seek consolation at Canterbury's revered shrine . The echo of their entertainment on the way resounds again , and we feel the stir of bygone hospitality which sought to refresh the holy marchers on their toilsome road . We recall , too , the ancient denunciations of these old - time spiritual wanderers , and the oft - repeated exhortations to the women to curb their longings and stay at home . There was Boniface , in the eighth century , for example , who rejected the idea that Englishwomen should make the pilgrimage to Rome , and there were objections to women pilgrims around the throne of Charlemagne . Then there was Alcuin , who offered cold comfort to our Abbess Ethelburge of Fladbury , when her projected pilgrimage was found to be impracticable , and who suggested that it was no great loss , for God had better designs for her . " Expend the sum thou hast gathered for the journey , " he hastened to add , in true ' anti - suffrage ' vein , " on the support of the poor , for if thou givest as thou canst , thou shalt reap as thou wilt . " But we recall , too , that , notwithstanding such outbursts , women continued to take part in the duties of their choice , and , if we may judge from the character of the Prioress , who formed one of Chaucer's merry company to Canterbury , the most refined , educated , and modest women in the land came forth from their home interests when their spiritual needs demanded their participation in such wanderings . So the pilgrimages flourished in spite of the critics , and this because the great inarticulate majority among the populations unconsciously recognised in these spiritual journeys the expres- sion of a living belief , and a sign that there was faith in the land . The aspirations of the populace in past centuries may , in fact , be gauged by the interpretation of their pilgrimages . Such journeyings were assuredly the culmination of long - hidden emotion , a yearning for personal salvation , a desire for indi- vidual well - being , or an overpowering longing for the merging of self ( at - one - ment ) with the source of spiritual life . It will be found that all miracles recorded as the supernatural happen- ings at the pilgrims ' goal are connected with one or other of such aspirations . The sick are cured , the blind see again , the cripple casts away his crutches , the man in thrall of a thirty- year - old obsession walks away in full control of his senses , the penitent and broken in spirit leaves the shrine as a new soul washed clean of guilt . Throughout , there is but the one note struck , that of a personal salvation ( of the self or another ) which was the expression , by means of the rite of pilgrimage , of the phase of individualism through which the evolution of civlisation had to proceed . But we live now in a new age , with other hungers and other needs , and we have awakened to the demands of society regarded as a whole before which the individualistic outlook is rapidly vanishing . Perhaps woman , with her instinctive mother - emo- tion , is more attuned to this fresh point - of - view ; possibly her apprenticeship at the family hearth has fitted her slowly and unconsciously to meet the demands of the new time , and thus she is responding more quickly than man to the modern appeal . Hence the expression of the new spiritual life which is stirring both the men and the women of to - day is most fittingly taking form in a Woman's pilgrimage ,

250 Again is heard a THE COMMON ** call in the land , and from North and South , from East and West , women leave their homesteads to join this new - time pilgrimage . But no longer does the hope of personal succour or individual salvation lure the wanderer to the promised goal , for each marcher knows , as she steps silently into the ranks , that she enlists as a soldier in a vast army , and by that act renews her pledge to work and wait , to live or die for the sake of the common cause . Grievous ills are rampant in our land , ours to share unfettered in the labour of reform ; such is the simple faith of the women pilgrims now on march . And as the wanderers pass through the great highways of our land , the reasonableness of their belief becomes still more apparent , for how shall they sit again in the peace of sheltered homes when they have seen a panorama of the dis- figurement of the country , and the misery of their fellows ? How shall those of us remain at rest who have passed through such districts as the " Potteries , " that " Hell with the lid off , " and have seen for ourselves the ravages among the population by an How shall we unnecessary and preventable industrial disease ? rear our own children in the pleasant places of our kingdom , without care for the luckless ones , when we have marched through the England of to - day , through the cities of whirring wheels , where babies rot and womanhood is destroyed , through the deserted and " pathetically helpless villages peopled by old men and white - faced children , the vicious and the mentally defective , " how shall we see on the one hand a ruined popula- tion in our own kingdom , and on the other hand , the beauty of the sunset on red - roofed barns , on smiling orchards and ripening cornfields the landlord's country , " without pledging our- selves to fight , for the rest of our lives if need be , for the weapon of the vote , so that we women may stand free alongside the noble - hearted men of our generation , to work for the emancipa- tion of this devitalised population . Thus the women's pil- grimage takes a place of deep significance among the happenings of the present day as a new sign in the new times that there is faith in the land , and by virtue of this living belief will public opinion be leavened in the end . Like the travelling friars of old , these women pilgrims are preaching as they go , in markets and fairs , and other open places where a great congregation of people is . " They are making the people of England pass sentence on their claim , and little by little , the righteousness of their cause will thereby penetrate to the heart of the nation , welding a unity that no political party will be able to dissolve . L. YATES . Women Factory Workers . Woher Report of H. M. Principal Lady Inspector . The report of H.M. Principal Lady Factory Inspector ( Miss A. M. Anderson ) , which has just been published , shows that though the conditions in which women work are still , for the most part , far from satisfactory , there has at any rate been There is a some improvement during the last few years . growing feeling among factory women that they are entitled to a living wage , decent sanitary conveniences and washing facilities , and a comfortable room in which to eat their meals . Employers , too , are evidently beginning to regard their female employees more in the light of human beings , entitled to con- siderate treatment and some degree of comfort , and less as mere . machines for producing wealth . Frequently , Miss Anderson points out , they welcome the Inspectors as friends : - Refreshing testimony has repeatedly come of the unflagging apprecia- tion by the workers of all that Inspectors try to do for them and from employers who increasingly look for council and experienced advice from them . ' It's gey handy to have the likes of you , ' a Scottish mother said when consulting Miss Vines on the effects of employment on her daughter's health , and the feeling is widely expressed in all sorts of ways , though not often so tersely . Anxiety on the part of employers to learn the Inspector's verdict after inspection of their factories is an everyday ordinary attitude now met with , but many go further and invite special advice on special problems , and occasionally there is a tendency to suggest that the employer of women's labour has a natural claim to a woman Inspector's advice on ' welfare ' work for his employees . One such went so far as to express it as a positive grievance that he had never been visited by a lady inspector before 1912. Two joint small employers , husband and wife , came before me in their eagerness to make the most of my chance visit . The husband pointed out all his views about the law and the Order under it : ' Listen to the lady , now , or you'll learn nothing , ' was presently the wife's advice , received as good humouredly as it was given . " Nevertheless , although it speaks of gradual improvement , Miss Anderson's document is sad reading enough . We learn of long hours , starvation wages , unjust fines , unhealthy conditions , and bullying by male overseers ; of girls injured by unfenced machinery or by lifting heavy loads ; acquiring terrible illnesses by working at dangerous trades , or breaking down under the

CAUSE . JULY 18 , 1913 . tremendous strain which the " speeding up " of modern industry involves . Indeed , the report makes us wonder whether the inventors of machinery were not the worst enemies of mankind- and still more of womankind . One fact that stands out clearly from the Report - though , of course it is not stated in so many words - is that the Government have been shamefully parsimonious in their appointment of Lady Factory Inspectors . The little band of devoted women who have given their best energies to the task of bettering the conditions of female employment are far too few for the duties with which they have to cope . With their present numbers , only an occa- sional visit can be paid to each factory or workshop , and the supervision exercised over bad employers is wholly inadequate . Space will not admit of a detailed account of all the grievances under which factory women and girls labour . Some of these- such as long hours and low wages - can scarcely be dealt with except by further legislation or combined resistance . But certain grievances of a glaring nature could easily be rectified . Fore- most among these is the question of fines , especially of reductions made in the case of goods spoilt by inexperienced workers , who , in some factories , are in the first place paid at a very low rate , on the ground of their inexperience , and are then mulcted of a considerable portion of that pay because they cannot accomplish properly work for which they have never been trained . Several employers have already followed , with good results , the Inspectors ' suggestions to try thorough and systematic instruc- tion and supervision of their workers as an alternative to the depressing automatic method of fining them until they do better , ' which apparently has had no good effect . " It is hoped that other employers will follow this example , and that fines for absence and unpunctuality will also be more justly regulated . The various Truck Acts - which to some extent regulate the fining of employees - are complicated , and badly in need of revision ; but much more could be effected without further legislation if there were an adequate staff of Lady Inspectors to discuss these questions with factory owners . A matter badly in need of legislation is the lifting of heavy weights by women and girls . The following is one example out of many : - " Owing to a complaint from a mother employed at an aerated water- works that she considered the heavy work of lifting and carrying done by the women had been the cause of the still - birth of her baby , I made inquiries . ( a ) Crates of twelve empty syphons weigh 68 lbs .; they are lifted by a woman washer from the buffer's wheel to the washing machines . ( b ) Crates of twenty - eight empty bottles , weight 42 lbs . , are lifted from the stack of cases of empty bottles a few feet off by a girl of seventeen to the washing tank . " " In other factories growing girls of fifteen were found em- ployed in lifting heavy weights - no wonder that the Inspector tired and jaded appearance . " was struck by their Other matters in urgent need of reform are the half - time employment of children under thirteen , and the whole - time work of children as young as thirteen and fourteen ; also the over- seeing of girls and young women by men . This leads to a good deal of bullying , and to not a little immorality . So little regard do employers often pay to elementary decency among their female employees that in many factories men - sometimes , to quote the Report , rough young men are placed in charge of the women's sanitary conveniences . One factory Inspector mentions a factory where the sanitary accommodation : - « for 80 girls doing high - class work , was found to be one convenience , and when new ones were added , with a cloakroom , the occupier desired ( though he was not allowed ) to fit glass panels to the door , in order that men should supervise and control the use of the place . " The provision of proper sanitary conveniences and washing facilities forms another burning question ; so , too , does the lack of a room set apart for meals , women and girls in some fac- tories being turned out into the rain in the dinner hour because the law forbids them to eat in the room in which they work .

JULY 18 , 1913 . THE COMMON Evolution in Sex . SEX ANTAGONISM . By Walter Heape , M.A. , F.R.S. ( London : Constable & Co. , 1913. 7s . 6d . net . ) Mr. Walter Heape is well known in the scientific world as He has an able and ardent specialist in the physiology of sex . lately become known to anthropologists through interesting con- tributions to Dr. Frazer's Tolemism and Exogamy on the relation of birth - marks to the origin of Tolemism . Finally , in the present book he gives us his views on the Suffrage question . Now the views of a first - rate specialist on any subject , even remotely connected with his own , are almost always worth attending to , and this book should certainly be read and pon- dered over by all who are interested in the social aspect of sex . But the view of a specialist must always , off his own immediate subject , be received with many grains of salt ; they are the views of a man whose vision is necessarily obscured by excessive focus . Mr. Heape looks out on the world as on a great stud - farm for the breeding of a superior kind of human " cattle . " In his supreme interest in the processes of begetting , by which life is engendered , life itself , in all its complexity , goes by the board . « His book falls awkwardly into two parts . First , his criticism of Dr. Frazer ; second , his own views on suffrage . Most un- equally are these two partners yoked together . Indeed , we suspect it to be no true marriage at all . We suspect - it is only suspicion that Mr. Heape's theory about exogamy arose from his specialist criticism of Dr. Frazer , arose , that is , from reasoned convictions ; whereas his views on suffrage arose probably from a quite natural male prejudice to any dominance of woman . We are all familiar , in the dark places of our own minds , with these sudden unnatural alliances between prejudice and reason , and , once the marriage effected , divorce is not easy . Exogamy , a common , almost universal , practice among savages , means marrying out , " i.e. , outside of a group . The practice seems astonishing and inconvenient . Why does not natural , unsophisticated man marry one or more of the women immediately around him ? Numerous theories have been mooted to account for a custom so inconvenient . Dr. Frazer derives exogamy from a natural , innate " horror of incest . " Mr. Heape shows we think rightly - that such an origin presup- poses qualities of reflection and self - restraint scarcely to be looked for in a savage . He finds the origin of exogamy in a ten- dency common to the human with other animal males ; that is the desire for the unfamiliar female , whose attractions have not been blunted by long juxtaposition as housemate ; witness , for instance , the behaviour of a buck - rabbit which has lived for long with certain does , on the introduction of a strange female ( p . 187 ) . Exogamy was man - made , and had for its end the maximum of sex - gratification . Tolemism , which restricted the roving freedom of the male , was an artificial system of restraint thought out by woman and accepted by man . " In a word , and some of Mr. Heape's words are very plain- spoken , sexual passion and sexual gratification are of far more moment to the male ; the ideal of the family is essentially a female sentiment to the male it is the sexual act which is of moment , while it is the consequence thereof which profoundly affects the female . When once the sexual act has been accomplished the male has no further interest or responsi- bility in the breeding function ; in the case of the female , how- ever , the opposite is true , new interest and responsibility begin only after union has been consummated . " In fact , all marriage laws , all sex restrictions , originate with the female , and are tolerated , or even " complacently " accepted by the male . Woman then , is the Law - giver - the Greeks called their great Corn - mother , Thesmophoros - and the delighted Suffragist will eagerly go out heart and soul to acclaim Mr. Heape as standard- bearer . Woman , from all time the Law - maker - for sex laws seem to have been among the earliest imposed - surely she may WOMEN'S SPECIAL I enclose promise a donation of £ ( Signed ) Name ( Mr. , Mrs. , or other Title . ) Address To the Hon .

CAUSE . 251 be allowed even in these degenerate days a vote in the making of laws ! Not at all . Mr. Heape is an ardent - though nowise an ignorant - Anti - Suffragist . Woman is not to vote ; above all , she is not to fight . Law - maker though by instinct she is , she must suppress her law - making instincts and devote her best young years to storing up nourishment " for the children that are to be . That is her biological function ; she is to live for the physical continuation of the race . It is the old , old story retold with a new scientific reinforcement - woman is to minister to man's pleasure and to continue his race ; her own life as a human individual counts for practically nothing . The worst that can be said of a most interesting , and in places illuminating , book , is that it suffers from this inherent , necessary blindness of the specialist . How can the race be best continued , is no doubt the first concern of the specialist in breeding . But the relations of the sexes have other and wider issues than the mere continuance of the race . Each individual life dropped by the race as it hurries on , each conscious indi- vidual unit is a focus of joy or pain unspeakable , and so of priceless value . Are half these units to be envisaged as mere vehicles for the transit of life ? We trow not . Mr. Heape's view of man as a sex is as distorted , we think , by specialism as his view of women . We all of us know count- less men who marry to found a home , to win a lifelong com- panion ; we all of us know men as tender and devoted to their children as any mothers . Mr. Heape may hold they are devirilised , but surely the good father has high social if not biological value . Is there really no such thing as evolution in sex ? Cannot man learn to care in marriage for something beyond the moment's intense physical pleasure , and may not woman , out of caring for her children , learn altruism enough to be a life's companion ? Given that Mr. Heape is right - and he probably is as to a basal sex antagonism , is not the whole of our civilisa- tion founded , not on the indulgence to the full of natural instincts , but on their gradual modification by other instincts ? The naturalistic analysis of the live man of to - day into the animal instincts which assuredly made him what he is , is a denial of life and reality , of durée which would bring tears to the eyes of Professor Bergson . With " creative evolution " all things are possible , even Votes for Women . JANE HARRISON , Writer of Homo Sum . An Important Appointment . All Suffragists will rejoice at the appointment of Miss Con- stance Smith as one of the Senior Inspectors of Factories . It will be remembered that two more Women Inspectors have recently been added to the seventeen already at work ; but it is , we understand , quite unprecedented for the Home Office to make an appointment from " outside . " Of course , Miss Smith's record of social service is a magnificent one , and her experience will be invaluable . She began work - as everyone does , " according to herself ! -as a novelist , and produced some six or seven novels , beginning with The Repentance of Paul Wentworth , and ending with Corban in 1901. But she was always interested in social work , and has been engaged in it now for over fourteen years . Her name was associated with that of Canon Gore - the present Bishop of Oxford - in the work of the Christian Social Union ; and she has also been specially interested in the Women's Trade Union League , whose admirable little quarterly she has edited now for about nine years . Miss Smith is an authority on all questions connected with women's industries , and also with child labour . Her name was among the members of the Industrial Law Committee , and the Committee on Wage - Earning Children , to which she is , with Miss Adler , Honorary Secretary . Is it necessary to add that Miss Constance Smith is a convinced Suffragist ? No , of course not . It goes without saying . PILGRIMAGE .

252 THE COMMON The Meaning of Why are the women of England taking so much trouble to get the vote ? Do they suppose that the vote will get them everything they want ? No ! But they know it will get some things , and some things that they very badly need . Last Friday it was stated in the House of Commons that women in some industries had to carry weights of 80 or even 100 pounds , and the Home Secretary was asked what he proposed to do about it ? He answered that he did not propose to do anything at present ! Do you think it right that women should carry weights like that ? Do you not think that if they had votes They would ask for better industrial conditions -and get them ? On the same day , the Home Secretary was asked case of a what he was going to do in the Magistrate who fined a man one penny for employing a girl of fourteen without a certificate of fitness . Again , he did not propose to do anything . He was asked if he would introduce better laws to prevent women from being unjustly fined . He said But men have been soon . " he hoped to deal with it IT IS that everyone in London 66 THE COMMON is the Official Organ of the Law - Abiding A LAW - ABIDING Unless you help us to sell this paper all will be created by other Suffrage papers , Militant one .

There are only a very few - perhaps only one - in which fines are a serious grievance to them , while Women are fined constantly and in a most unjust way , because they have no weapon with which to protect their interests . The Chief Lady Inspector of Factories has just published her report . In it , she says many times , that women ought to be protected from this injustice . But she has said it before , and nothing has been done . Do you think it fair to protect the stronger and leave the weaker out ? We women do not think it fair . And that is Why we have been on Pilgrimage from all parts of England and Wales , to put our Cause and our demands before you . Perhaps you will be inclined to say " But women have behaved so badly that they ought not to be given the vote . They have shown that they are not fit to have it ! " If page you say that , we ask you to look at the front of this paper , where you will see it is the paper of Law - Abiding Suffragists . If you look at the Pilgrims , you will see that they

These are the colours of a great Union , which has always used perfectly lawful and peaceable methods of carrying on its agitation .

You have no doubt heard that some women have burned down houses and broken windows , but do you think it fair to you A great Punish the innocent with the guilty ? Would think it fair in the case of men ? many political agitations carried on by men have been marked by violence . Nobody dreams of punishing all men because a few of them broke the law !

We wish , indeed - and no one can wish it so heartily as the law - abiding Suffragists - that the Women's agitation had been entirely free from all appeals to violence . But we cannot think it fair that all of us should be condemned , any more than men would think it fair if they were condemned for the sins of a few . What is sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose ! We ask you to remember that : - We have to obey the laws , as well as men . We are punished if we disobey , as well as men . We have to pay taxes , as well as men . We have to suffer if our country is badly governed , as men do . It is just as important to us as to men that the laws under which we live should be wise and just . If our rulers make mistakes we suffer as much as anyone else . For all these reasons we think we ought to vote , as well as men .

254 THE COMMON to be a recognised wit of Newark . A drunken man on the other side of the platform , later on , was especially interested in our respective ages and knowledge of laundry work . Very soon the uproar made speaking practically impossible , and stones , mud , and all manner of vegetable produce were showered upon us from every side . Luckily the only egg thrown missed the platform and hit a jeering enemy very neatly on the nose . This secured a momentary lull , and Miss Beaver was able to make herself heard for a few moments ; but the uproar soon broke out again , and several attempts were made to rush the platform . " We are three women against three thousand men , " cried Miss Beaver . " If you want to injure us , now is your chance ; we are This remark made our assailants pause for a quite defenceless . " moment , but the hooligans soon urged another rush , and in spite of the entreaties of a magistrate and the Chief Superintendent of Police , the crowd steadfastly refused to listen . Eventually we were persuaded by the police to leave the platform , and were with difficulty extricated from the crowd and escorted to a hotel . No words can describe the courage shown by Miss Manners and Miss Beaver , the unruffled cheerfulness of the former being beyond all praise . TURTLE - DOVES AND FOOTBALLERS . At Stamford on Saturday we had again an audience of turtle- doves at one platform , and another of athletic tastes which insisted on playing football whenever it was not whistling , booing , or singing hymns . At the beginning of the meeting , however , the audience appeared eager to listen , and would doubtless have remained so had two drunken interrupters been removed by the police with the prompt- ness usually shown in cases of interruption by militant suffragettes . These two men practically succeeded in breaking up our meeting , but the crowd was perfectly good - humoured throughout , and the speakers stood on the platform convulsed with merriment , while magic circles were formed in the crowd and a leader was chosen to step cautiously into the centre and light what was apparently intended to be a suffragette bomb - fuse . Miss Garlick , Miss Beaver , and another speaker each contrived to make themselves heard for some time by more peaceful members of the audience , and though we had to be extricated once more by the police and removed to a friend's house for safety , it is doubtful whether the crowd had at any time really hostile intentions . Two of our men pilgrims were kicked by the crowd , and a feeble attempt was made to hustle us into the river ; but a large part of the audience cheered us at the end , and expressed hope to hear us again . Stamford , we were told by the police , seldom listens quietly at meetings , and Saturday night is usually the time when its inhabitants are in specially playful mood . WATLING STREET . WILMA MEIKLE . PILGRIMS ' MESSAGE UNDERSTOOD . During the last week we have been tramping through the densely populated Midland towns , and each day spent on this route makes one realise more and more that in no other way could we have reached the thousands of men and women who are now listening to our message and beginning to understand the work of the constitutional suffragists who are determined to win the vote by Reason , not Force . We pilgrims , too , as we witness the squalid poverty and misery of the men and women - the wretched conditions under which the children are growing up into little hooligans , are having it burnt into our souls that we must never rest until we are given power to alter these conditions . At Burslem the Pilgrims came into the area of the West Midland Federation , and Miss Watson took over charge . We were a very merry party at the tea provided by the Stoke Society , after which a meeting was held , and we then formed up , and , with a band , marched on to Hanley . Major and Mrs. Cecil Wedgwood - the former head of the Wedgwood firm , and a leading Conservative - marched with us , and also spoke at the meeting . AN EXCITING ESCAPE . At Hanley we found a packed mass of people numbering about 10,000 , awaiting our arrival in the Market Square . Miss Margaret Ashton and Councillor Bedemer , and other speakers , addressed the crowd from three platforms , and while the speaking was going on this huge audience was kept well in hand , the men listening with great attention , and the resolution passing at all the platforms . At the end , however , the hooligan element became unmanageable , and for a short time there was considerable danger that the speakers and pilgrims might be injured . We were all finally rescued by motor- Dr. Boyd did cars , and were driven to our respective lodgings . yeoman service in protecting the pilgrims from the violence of the crowd , and putting his car at their disposal . INADEQUATE POLICE PROTECTION . Next morning the pilgrims turned up at Stoke , none the worse for their rough experience , and marched out of the Town accom- panied by a band ; then bade farewell to our local hosts and continued their journey to Stone and Stafford . There , again , a huge crowd of seven to eight thousand assembled ; and this time not a very friendly one . The speakers , however , held their own from two platforms in spite of some interruptions , and all would have passed This was not off well if there had been adequate police protection . forthcoming , and on returning home Miss Ashton - who had been speaking - was set upon by a few hooligans and slightly hurt . However , with her usual courage , she appeared the next morning ,

The mid - day halt on Friday was at Puckridge , and at 6 p.m. the Pilgrims had reached Wolverhampton and had a warm greeting from the local Society , who provided tea . Here the Shropshire contingent of Pilgrims poured in , having had a fine " send off " from Shrewsbury , where a meeting was held , and again at Wellington where they were entertained at tea . << WOLVERHAMPTON'S RECORD MEETING . The special feature in the procession from Shrewsbury was the addition of three suffragist babies in their perambulators and the words non - militant stitched into their hats - this idea of the mothers was an object lesson that the home keeping women want the vote for the sake of their children . A very fine meeting was held at Wolverhampton , and though a band of silly youths tried to interrupt they were kept in thorough check . An old inhabitant told me that he had never seen such a fine open - air meeting in Wolver- hampton before . Lady Rochdale , who is accompanying our route nearly the whole way , was one of the speakers . Saturday was very strenuous , but most inspiring and satisfactory day . Our route lay along tram lines , and we were the object of interest to hundreds of people from start to finish . Our first halt was at Wednesbury , where the men out on strike came in large numbers to hear us speak and showed great interest and sympathy . At West Bromwich the local Society entertained us at luncheon after which we held a most enthusiastic meeting . At the close a band was waiting to escort us on our way to Birmingham . When we were within two miles of that city a strong contingent of the Birmingham Society , also accompanied by a band , met us . Tea was provided for the Pilgrims by the Society , and an invalid member presented to each pilgrim a dainty box of chocolate . A meeting was held at Queen's College , with the Rev. A. P. Roberts in the Chair , the principal speakers being Lady Rochdale and Miss Ashton . KATHERINE M. HARLEY . PILGRIMS FROM THE SOUTH - WEST . A FAIR HEARING AT BRIDGWATER . On Wednesday morning the pilgrims marched out from the Taunton Market Place along the Bridgwater Road accompanied by many sympathisers both driving and walking . At North Petherton they found the men were in the village for the dinner hour , and an impromptu meeting was held , at which Mrs. W. C. H. Cross and Mrs. Harold Hicks , of Bristol , spoke . A further meeting was held at 4.30 , when Mrs. Ramsay took the chair . She excited much interest , because although an elderly lady she had come all the way from Land's End . Mrs. Hicks also spoke . She was recognised by many of the men as an old Election acquaintance , but in her speech she laid especial stress on the non - party character of the National Union . People along the route were very kindly , though rather inclined to confuse the Pilgrims with the Militants . One man , who lent his orchard for the pilgrims to rest in , facetiously remarked : " You may burn the nettles , but please leave me my apple trees . 33 At Bridgwater rumours were plentiful of intended disturbances , but the enormous crowd which collected at Penel Orlien was entirely orderly . Colonel Caulfield - Stoker , of Burnham , took the chair . Miss Sterling proposed , and W. Brown , Esq . , seconded , the resolution , which was carried , and about fifty people signed " Friends of Women's Suffrage " cards . It is reported that the orderly characted of the meeting was largely due to the efforts of two large employers in the town who used all their influence to induce their men to give the women a fair hearing . One man was heard to say : " The Law's agin ' us , it won't let us do what we would like to ' em , " but the general feeling seemed to be that as the speakers were what one man described anti - militant " they ought to be allowed to state their case . On Thursday morning the pilgrims assembled at Northfields , Bridgwater , and marched through the town ; then by way of Chedzoy , Sutton Mallet , and Moorlinch to Street . At Moorlinch a dinner - hour meeting was held . The speakers were introduced by Mr. L. Taylor , of Weston - super - Mare , and addresses were given by Mrs. Ramsay and Miss A. M. Clough , of Bristol . Mrs. W. S. Clark , of Street , also said a few words . Another halt was called at Ashcott , where a small meeting was held . as HEARTY WELCOME AT STREET . From Street the supporters of the movement marched out with a goodly display of banners to meet the pilgrims , and a procession was formed with a band at the head , which marched through the town to the meeting place . All the inhabitants of the town turned out to see the procession , which was led by a decorated donkey carriage with two tiny boys , the great - grandsons of John Bright . So large was the audience in the field that two platforms were used for the meeting . The Chairmen were W. S. Clark , Esq . , J.P. , and C. Whitlow , Esq . , and the speakers were Miss Frances Sterling , Mrs. Harold Hicks , Miss Walford , and Councillor Ayles ( of Bristol ) . On Friday the short march to Glastonbury was accomplished in plenty of time for a well - attended dinner - hour meeting at the Market Cross The Mayor , W. Doidge , Esq . , who had promised to take the chair , was unfortunately ill , but his place was taken by J. Morland , Esq . , J.P. The speakers were Miss Walford , Miss Sterling , Mrs. Ramsay , and Miss Vincent . GREEN APPLES AND CLODS . At Wells there were crowds of people to see a flying exhibition . From the field they came up to the meeting in the Market Place , and

Randall Vickers , the speakers being Mrs. Randall Vickers and Miss Sterling . The resolution was carried . At the conclusion of the meet- ing the pilgrims had some little difficulty in getting back to their hotel , owing to the attentions of some rough men and boys . Luckily nothing harder than green apples and clods of earth was thrown , though the experience was unpleasant no harm was done . Two men of the town , not sympathisers , did their best to get the women out their awkward predicament . A PEACEFUL SATURDAY . Saturday's march was through the beautiful Mendip country . halt was made in every village to distribute leaflets and chat with the villagers , and at Westbury and Draycott small meetings were held . Cheddar was reached in time for lunch , and at 2.30 a meeting was held in a natural amphitheatre about halfway up the famous Cheddar Gorge . Here a large number of people assembled , as being Saturday there were many visitors . The chair was taken by Preb Yorke Faussett , and the speakers were Miss Walford and Mrs. Yorke Faussett . The resolution was put , and carried with acclamation Many COMMON CAUSES were sold , and a large collection taken . Another small meeting was held at Axbridge , and then the pilgrims marched on to Winscombe , where they were welcomed by the local society Here a meeting was held at 7 o'clock . R. C. Burn , Esq . , M.A. , was in the chair , and the speakers were A. Daniell , Esq . , LL.B. , of Bristol and Miss Frances Sterling . This concluded the week's work . Altogether the pilgrims have obtained 235 Friends of Women's Suffrage and have collected nearly £ 8 in five days , which , in a scattered agricultural district , speaks volumes for the amount of interest shown . CARDIFF TO NEWPORT . A GOOD SEND - OFF . In preparation for the Pilgrimage , the Cardiff Society organised a series of open - air meetings during the past week , Miss Helen Fraser coming to speak for us after leaving the S. Western Federation at Exeter . On Friday night we had a mass meeting in the centre of the City , when Miss Fraser gave an account of the Pilgrimage The next morning we formed up near the same spot , many more members taking part in the procession than were expected a few weeks ago . Others , whom we hope on some future occasion to have walking with us , gave us a friendly send off . The banners and the caps and gowns of the university members gave the necessary colour to the scene , and the sympathy of the crowds through which we passed made the march out of the City a pleasant journey . Some members were only able to walk a short way , but a good contingent marched the whole twelve miles to Newport , while about half - a - dozen proceeded on bicycles . All along the road we distributed leaflets , left them at the cottage doors , spoke to the passers by , and sold COMMON CAUSES , and we held an open - air meeting in a tiny village through which we passed . Newport arranged a big open - air meeting at which Miss Helen Fraser and Mrs. Philip Snowden were the speakers , and this proved a great success in spite of the fact that anti - militant feeling had been roused by Mrs. Mackworth the previous day . Our experience all along the road was that we had to deal with " anti - militant " feeling , but with very little " anti - suffrage " feeling . The most striking change in the last years seems to me to be in the attitude of the labouring women . They are so much more alive to their own value and their own needs , and answering to this there is a greater sense of friendship between men and women , so that one now hardly ever meets a labouring man who expresses any fear or anger at the prospect of his wife or daughter having a vote . ERIC EVANS . PILGRIMS FROM CROMER . COMPARATIVE CALM REIGNS . At Cromer , on the morning of the 11th , the pilgrims started on the Eastern Counties central route . The day was perfect for enter- prise . A thick sea mist rolled away and left the sun shining upon us as we planted our banner upon the cliff . An audience of about 200 gathered about in groups and listened with quiet attention to Mrs. Cowmeadow's explanation of the pilgrimage and general state- ment of our position . Then we started , our colours streaming out well , and the little procession making a brave show as we went through the town and took the road towards Aylsham . Arriving there in the dinner hour we held a short impromptu meeting in the Market Square , announcing the evening meeting to follow . At the latter there was an audience of some 300. Before leaving for Norwich on Saturday we did some canvassing . Five members and several Friends were enrolled in Aylsham and neighbourhood . At Norwich on Saturday evening the meeting in the market place numbered some 400 - Mrs Cowmeadow and Mr. Mirrlees spoke . There was a good deal of heckling , but no active hostility . Throughout the three days our reception has been , on the whole , decidedly friendly , with the usual mixture of some jeering and some indifference . One man greeted the word " law - abiding " on our banner with , " ' Ow do we know they're not paid by the militants to say so ? " On Sunday morning at the Friends ' Meeting House , Norwich , Mrs. Cowmeadow gave an excellent address on the spiritual aims of our movement , with special reference to the attitude of the Society of Friends on the equality of the sexes .

256 THE COMMON START FROM EAST COAST FISHING TOWNS . BROOMSTICK VERSUS UMBRELLA . On Thursday , July 9th , the Yarmouth Society had a meeting with two platforms in the Market Square , and large audiences came to hear the Suffrage speakers . On the following morning we assembled in front of the Town Hall , and set off , about sixty strong , on the first stage of our journey , our forces being swelled by a group of men from the Caistor Socialist camp . On leaving the outskirts of the town we were given a rousing cheer . The weather was glorious , and the interest of the start was heightened by an aeroplane circling above us . At the small village of Corton we halted and lunched , and after- wards held a sleepy meeting . We entered Lowestoft about thirty strong , counting those who came out to meet us . In the evening Mr. and Mrs. Vulliamy and Mrs. Heitland spoke to a huge audience , which extended beyond earshot . Compared with the audience at the Yarmouth and Corton meetings , the crowd was troublesome , and after all Suffragists had dispersed a howling mob A careered round Lowestoft out of sheer delight at being a mob . male supporter who kindly carried away one of the banner's was attacked with a broomstick , and retaliated with his umbrella . On Friday morning we assembled at the N. Station , Lowestoft , and , after some speaking , marched along the miles of road of which Lowestoft consists . Crowds turned out to see us all along the line , and the opportunity we had for distributing literature was unique . Arrived at Pakefield , Mrs. Ponder addressed an audience composed largely of fish girls ; at the beautiful village of Kessingland our banners attracted a crowd , and a good meeting was held . At Wrent- ham and Wangford we also had good audiences , and Mr. and Mrs. Vulliamy , who did most of the speaking , were fairly exhausted by the end of the day . On Saturday we had a tiny meeting at Blythburgh in the morning , and were entertained afterwards by Southwold to a delightful picnic on Wenhaston Common . In the afternoon a small meeting was held at Wenhaston , and in the evening a very good one at Southwold . L. F. WARING . THROUGH THE FENS . A MIXED RECEPTION . Hunstanton pilgrims held a successful beach meeting on July 10th , the eve of their departure . Notwithstanding the gloomy evening a large audience assembled and listened most attentively to Mrs. Rackham . The pilgrims left next morning in a large brake con- spicuously decorated with the N.U. colours , amidst manifestations of through " pilgrims arrived in sympathy from the bystanders . The " King's Lynn the same day , having carried out much propaganda by the wayside . They were escorted into Lynn by local Suffragists , and held a most successful meeting at the Walk Gates . The departure from Lynn was speeded by the local society , but the arrival at Wisbech was less cheerful as this place vouchsafed no welcome . An evening meeting was shamefully interrupted by drunken roughs . Mrs. Rackham had to retreat once before their attempted violence , but the arrival of the police enabled her to resume her place , Further violence . which she did amidst the cheers of the audience . brought the meeting to a premature close , to the chagrin of many MARGUERITE HAZARD . attentive hearers . WAKING UP SOUTH KENT . " TOO SENSIBLE TO BE MILITANTS . " It is my part to tell of perhaps one of the most difficult routes which the pilgrims have attempted . In the first place , there are few societies in South Kent , and secondly , the societies that there are , are very small . Mrs. Abbott , our speaker , Miss Gimingham , the Treasurer , and myself , started with a meeting at Sandwich on July 3rd . As a matter of fact , that was the noisiest gathering that we have had . ( Do the children ever go to bed in South Kent ? ) The next night we went to Great Eastry , and on the Saturday to Deal , where we had a most orderly meeting , and sold a large quantity of COMMON CAUSES . It is difficult to recall each meeting distinctly , as always the trifles remain in the memory . At Great Eastry one remembers the hearty cheer with which we were sent off , and the good wishes of the gypsies ; at Kingsdown the small straggling crowd and the cold wind blowing from a grey sea ; at St. Margaret's , brilliant sunshine and white cliffs , and the assurance from the villagers that we looked " too sensible to be militants " ; and at Dover , first the band of a dozen or so , march- ing in their colours through the town , and then the dense black crowd and the play of a lighthouse on the sea and on the speaker . Our thanks are due for the help given at Dover by the Constitutional Society both in coming to the meeting and in subscriptions . Mrs. Abbott has spoken splendidly , and now Miss Cooke has joined us and will help with the speaking till the 21th , when we join the North Kent route at Tonbridge - Oh , joyful day ! KATHARINE WARD . NORTH KENT PILGRIMS . A belated report comes from the North Kent Route of successful open- air meetings , addressed by Miss Muriel Matters and Miss Griffith Jones , at Birchington , Herne Bay , Tankerton , Whitstable , Canterbury , Faver- sham , Green Street , and Sittingbourne . At Whitstable Mr. Lang M.P. , reiterated his belief in women's enfranchisement from the Suffrage platform , ana a telegram from Mr. Bennett - Goldney , confirming his Suffrage views , was read at Canterbury . The reception of the Pilgrims has everywhere been satisfactory ; have been enrolled , and many hundreds of members and " Friends COMMON CAUSES sold . SUPPORT OUR ADVERTISERS and mention

On Sunday , July 27th , the Pilgrims who wish to attend the Service in St. Paul's will meet at 1.45 in Trafalgar Square , and go together to the Cathedral . The service begins at 3.15 , but as it is always crowded , it is necessary to be there in plenty of time in order to ensure getting seats . THE PILGRIMAGE AND THE POLICE . We have received an earnest protest against the conduct of the police towards Suffragists from Mr. Philip Bellows , a member of the Society of Friends . He points out that again and again women are treated with insult and even brutally , and their meetings broken up , without any arrests being made . We think it right to say that , with a few exceptions , reports from the Pilgrims agree that the police are perfectly friendly , and anxious to protect the meetings from disturbance ; but that there seems even now to be no realisation of the enormous crowds likely to gather round our speakers , and consequently the number of policemen on duty is again and again Therefore , though far the larger number of quite inadequate . meetings are quite orderly , this order is chiefly due to the sympathetic attitude of the crowd as a whole . And when the speakers have finished and are leaving the pitch , the few hooligan's present seize the opportunity to hustle , insult , and even attack them . It is here that the inadequacy of the police protection is a real danger . " BUFFER " MEETINGS . Societies who have organised " buffer " meetings will earn the gratitude of the Pilgrims ! The idea is that in places where militancy has aroused peculiarly bitter feeling , and our Pilgrims are likely to be attacked before people know who they are , meetings should be held before their arrival . Instead of tired marchers , those who have not been able to take the road will explain the nature of the Pilgrimage and win it a friendly reception . If they suffer in so doing , they will be proud to know that , after all , they have been able to share the hardships of the march , and they will make things easier for the Pigrims when they come . THE LIGHTER SIDE . Kidnapped ! That the Antis have their fingers on the trigger when game is about has never been in doubt for a moment . Elderly gentlemen who wander unattended in the by - ways and highways , please note . At Barnsley , one of this unoffending species was kidnapped in broad daylight by a party of Antis , who rightly opined that he was on his way to take part in welcoming the Pilgrims . All is fair in war , we know , and he was permitted to accept the offer of a lift , under the impression that he would be driven to the nearest coign of vantage After a perilous journey , which , having consideration for the decline of the birth - rate the Antis should never have risked , they set him down at a village six miles from his destination . He never even smiled Some people can't see a joke . For useful articles of attire for the Pilgrimage , Messrs . Swan & Edgar are specially catering , and in the ribbon department they are stocking the National Union colours , 3 ins . wide , at Is . 2d . per yard , suitable for millinery trimming , sashes , & c .

258 RIOTING OLD AND NEW . THE At Fountains Abbey the Pilgrims paid their shillings and entered the ruins . The attendants ( contrary to the generally accepted idea held that ruins and Suffragists could not possibly amalgamate . with much trepidation - albeit with a certain worthy devotion - they followed the ladies from pillar to post as they examined the once famous Abbey righteously laid low in the cause of masculine riot freedom . For two solid hours the custodians shadowed their visitors Suffragists must be bomb - throwers and hair - pullers , what else could they be ? And was there not one amongst them who , if report spoke truly , had hit a man on the nose for molesting her ? Truly a most violent , blood - thirsty jade . The worthy custodians threw out their hollow chests and braced their wilting sinews - they were men , thank goodness ! All the same , when one of the ladies , as the hour of departure drew nigh , presented their janitors with neatly folded leaflets of " Protest Against Violence , something like an anti- climax came upon the heroes of Fountain Abbey . Their visitors had departed , the old stones remained . Shades of Henry VIII . and Cromwell ! " A PILGRIMAGE FOR MEN . When the American Suffragists walked in procession , a man who thought he was a humourist wrote to the New York Journal to ask " What he ought to wear , if he joined the march ? " The Journal replied : - Inquiring man , you might wear a fat baby about two years old , weighing forty - five pounds . Wear this baby on your left arm , and march for about six miles , and then you will know something about one thing that women have done for centuries . Or you might take a large basket of newly washed clothes , weighing about sixty - five pounds , and drag that along with you , and at the same time try to hold up your skirts and keep your feet out of the muddy streets . Then you would know how some women have been marching along for a long time . Or you might carry a pail full of hot water and soapsuds , with a scrubbing brush , walk along a few steps , get down on your knees and scrub , get up again , walk farther , scrub again . Do this and you will know how thousands upon thousands of old women , on the verge of starvation , are marching ' at night on their hands and knees on the hard stone floors of big office buildings , while you are sound asleep . But , best of all , if you really want to find out why it is that women should have the suffrage , take a market basket on one arm and take a baby too young to be left safely at home on the other arm , and march along solemnly , stopping at different shops as you go , and FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO LIVE . 6 " 3 LATEST NEWS FROM THE ROUTES . A WELCOME RESPITE . After their lively experiences during the week - end , Pilgrims on the Great North Road have been enjoying a period of calm . Friendly little meetings have been held at Oundle and Thrapston , the market - day audience at the latter town showing a most intelligent interest , and asking several thoughtful questions . At the close of the meetings very kind hospitality was given at both places ; and at Thrapston Mrs. Buckley put up fourteen pilgrims at Clapton Manor , and gave many of them a lift next day . SUFFRAGE SERVICES IN LIVERPOOL . Watling Street Pilgrims spent their Sunday at Birmingham , where many of them attended services arranged by churches of various denominations . At the Cathedral Bishop Hamilton Baynes preached on the spiritual aspect of Women's Suffrage . At Carr's Lane Con- gregational Church intercessions were offered at the Choral Cele- bration . Pilgrims also attended a special meeting at the Friends ' Meeting House , and were afterwards entertained at tea ; a kind thought which was much appreciated . In the evening an open - air meeting was held in the Bull Ring , which attracted a large crowd , and at which great sympathy was evinced . SERVICE IN CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL . At Canterbury a Suffragist procession passed through the City to attend an afternoon service in the Cathedral , and on Sunday morning the Vicar of Sittingbourne preached a sympathetic sermon , urging that men and women should found their opinions on " knowledge , not prejudice . " After an enormous and very successful meeting at Faversham , the Pilgrims were entertained to supper by the Liberal Club . We hear with regret that the names of seven Societies in the North and East Ridings Federation , which took part in the Pilgrim- age on the Great North Road were omitted from the report . They are Middlesbrough , Saltburn , Redcar , Whitby , Scarborough , Scalby , and York . Two of these have only recently affiliated , and it says much for their energy and enthusiasm that they were able to take part in a work demanding such sacrifice of time and money as the Pilgrimage . The success of the march in the North and East Ridings Federation was largely due to the energy of Miss Dutton , who has been working indefatigably for some weeks against considerable odds . With exceptions of one or two meetings only , the result of the Pilgrimage in the North and East Ridings Federation has been most gratifying , and the organisers are satisfied that much valuable work has been done , which will bear plentiful fruit in the days to come . Hampshire , Surrey , and Sussex will be astir with " Pilgrims during the current and the ensuing week , as , thanks to the indefatig- able energy of the Federation organisers , it has been arranged that London shall be approached along three lines of routes .

Preparations for the Scottish Suffrage Summer School are proceeding apace , and the addition of Mrs. Fawcett's name to the long list of distinguished lecturers is the crowning attraction on the syllabus . In view of recent militant happenings in Fife , the University authorities have imposed one or two new con- ditions upon the school , but these are not such as to seriously handicap our work and we have found no difficulty in complying with them . Applications are coming in well , and the members already enrolled hail from twenty different localities , from Inverness to Monmouth . The first session , August 11th to 18th , will be inaugurated by an address from Mrs. Fawcett on the International Movement , the second by Miss L. I. Lumsden , Scotland's most distinguished woman educationalist . Both these ladies hold the honorary LL.D. degree of the University of St. Andrews . Amongst our other speakers and teachers are Miss Chrystal Macmillan , M.A. , M.Sc .; Councillor Margaret Ashton , M.A .; Miss Isabella Ford ; Miss Clementina Black ; Miss Margaret Bondfield ; Miss M. S. Ker ( Parish Councillor , Glasgow ) ; Mrs. Annot Robinson ; Miss Griffith - Jones ; Mrs. Hunter ( Vigilance Association ) ; Miss C. M. Gordon , M.A. , and Mrs. J. J.

The Housing Problem . We receive the announcement by Mr. Runciman of the in- tention of the Government to deal with the Rural Housing problem with somewhat mingled feelings . His scheme does suggest at least that the President of the Board of Agriculture has grasped the magnitude of the evil - he speaks of 10,000 cot- tages to begin with " -and for this we shall all be thankful . At the same time , it is melancholy to think that such a question -so thorny , so controversial , and so tragically important- should have been left till so late a date in the life of this Parlia- ment .

Long columns in the local newspapers , excellent pictures , and appreciative articles greet the Pilgrims As they as they march through the various Federations . approach within the London radius , the friendly London papers are preparing to follow suit . The press recognises that the Suffragists are demonstrating what they set out to demonstrate i.e. , the widespread demand for the vote , and the strength throughout the country of constitutional methods of propa- ganda . Pilgrims who wish to see incidents in the March repro- duced , should visit the cinematograph shows on the night of July 26th , when the Pathé Gazette will show views of the Pro- cession in its diary of events . " The Daily Citizen has had particularly sympathetic articles lately , encouraging the women who are marching to London , and its leader on Democracy on July 14th is an excellent com- ment on Mr. Holford Knight's letter in the Westminster Gazette , of July 7th . Alluding severely to the perpetual evasions of the Government , the Daily Citizen says this week : - " The Government are to be blamed for evading the wider issues of Suffrage . The absurd anomaly of the plural voter is by no means the only injustice , or the deepest injustice , of the electoral system , which is moth - eaten with hardships and contradicitons .

Constituencies of Anti - Suffragist Ministers . 5 1 1 £ 500 wanted for Special Campaigns in the Autumn . Our work in the constituencies of five of the Anti - Suffragist Ministers is bringing in most encouraging results . Societies are being formed , large numbers of " Friends Women's Suffrage are being enrolled , resolutions are passed by organised bodies of all kinds protesting against attitude of the Government towards the women's demand representation . The Trades Unions and Labour organisations are as usual proving our best friends . In those constituencies where there is a prospect of a Labour candidate taking the our workers are helping the Labour Party in the important work of registration , and in the course of that work they acquiring a knowledge of local conditions which will very useful when the election comes . We should like to be able to organise special paigns in these five constituencies in the autumn . We to concentrate our E.F. F. speakers and workers in each tuency in turn for ten days or so , to canvass , hold meetings general propaganda work , and gain strong local support Women's Suffrage . We hope to enlist the help of volunteers from all the neighbouring Societies and Federations - larly those people on whom we shall depend when the comes in order that they may get practice and experience the special kind of work which will be needed , and familiar with the place and the people . For example , constituency will be mapped out into canvassing districts , each district will , as far as possible , be put in charge of person who will be responsible for it in the election . voluntary workers will have the advantage of working with experienced E.F.F. organisers , who have been through by - election campaigns of the past year and worked with much success at Crewe and Midlothian and Houghton - le - To carry out these campaigns on a really effective scale cost £ 100 in each constituency . The E. F. F. Committee does feel justified in voting so large a sum out of the ordinary at its disposal , but is confident that an appeal for this purpose will meet with a ready response . Who will give the necessary £ 500 to enable us to carry these campaigns in the constituencies of Mr. McKenna Monmouth ) , Mr. Lewis Harcourt ( Rossendale ) , Mr. ( Rotherham ) , Mr. Hobhouse ( E.

For the last few weeks all our time and thought . have been centred upon the Pilgrimage . Only one Society - Harrogate - was on the line of March through our Federation area , consequently , many members who would have liked to join us were prevented from doing so , and our numbers were small , but we find consolation in the thought that much new ground was broken , and many meetings held in places hitherto untouched . Meetings were held in Northallerton , Bedall , Masham , Gravel- thorpe , Ripon , Harrogate , Spofforth , and Wetherby , to which the whole population appeared to have turned out , and there were many requests to " come again . " About 25 dozen COMMON CAUSES were sold , 120 " Friends " cards signed , and many new mem- bers joined . Contingents came from the Societies at Wentby , Filey , Scalby , Middlesbrough , Saltburn , Redcar , Hull , Harrogate , and Scarborough , some marching with us for a stage or two , others taking part in a demonstration only , and some intend to come to the Hyde Park Demonstration . We are grateful to the Harrogate Society for all the kindly hospitality extended to us , and to the many friends , old and new , who helped us by the way . One is glad to have had some small share in an experience so inspiring and encouraging as our Suffrage Pilgrimage has proved to be . MARGARET DUTTON . We should specially like to thank Mrs. de Bunsen , who came from Knaresborough to take the Chair at the Ripon meeting , and who also sent her motor from Harrogate to Wetherby . Miss Thornton , Hon .

A great deal of important propaganda work has been accomplished in Ireland lately . Miss Geraldine Cooke , N.U.W.S.S. , has made an extensive tour , speaking and organising . Her campaign opened in Kilkenny , where she and Miss Mary Strangman , M.D. , T.C. , addressed a rather riotous meeting in the Town Hall . In spite of this , however , a favour- able impression was aroused , and there is good hope of ultimately making Kilkenny a stronghold of Suffrage . In Munster , Miss Cooke visited the Town Halls of Dunmanway and Kinsale . There were large attendances , and Miss Cooke and Miss Day were listened to with interest . Miss Cooke also addressed a meeting given by Miss Day in the grounds of Myrtle Hill House . A very large crowd assembled


### Column 2

Federations . at 261 to hear Miss Cooke and Miss Day in St. Patrick Street , Cork , on the early - closing day . All classes were represented , including some very poor women from a slum section of the city . These good ladies were extremely enthusiastic and sympathetic . Another very successful open - air meeting was held Buttervant , Miss Cooke and . Miss Cummins speaking . At the end of the meeting an ex - sergeant of police said that women should not only have the vote , but every profession should be open to them , including the law . Another member of the constabulary very kindly drove the speakers to the train . Mrs. Cowan ( Hon . Secretary of the Birr S.S. ) organised a meeting for Miss Cooke at Banagher , Co. Tipperary . The interest aroused was quite amazing , and it is hoped that Mrs. Cowan will be able to inaugurate a branch of this Society there . Her most remarkable success awaited Miss Cooke in Enniscorthy . As halls were refused for the meeting , it was held in the Market Square . When the speakers ceased , the huge crowd , mostly men , gathered round the woganette to buy pamphlets , and the whole supply of literature was exhausted in a few minutes . In Maryboro ' a slight disturbance was caused by some youths letting off toy bombs . Some sympathetic men came forward . however , and secured the Suffragists a fair hearing . When the speakers ceased , there was a call for " three cheers for two plucky ladies " ( Miss Cooke and Miss Lily Day ) , and there was hearty and unanimous applause . Mrs. Macredy , of Vallambrosa , Bray , lent her beautiful garden for a Suffrage " At home " June 28th . Miss Cooke spoke , and a good collection was taken , and new members enlisted . Miss Cooke was in Sligo from June 30th to July 3rd , and will visit Warrenpoint and Portrush before returning to England . on Mrs. Crichton , the energetic Organiser of the new Society at Sligo , has been doing splendid work . She is arranging for a " Suffrage week " in Sligo at the end of July , during which open - air meetings will be held , a Suffrage play given , and a Suffrage shop and other means of propaganda started . A meeting of protest against the " Cat and Mouse " Bill was held in the Mansion House , Dublin , on June 28th . The hall was crowded by an audience completely sympathetic with the object of the meeting . A garden fête , organised by the Irish- women's Reform League , for July 12th , is to take place at 3 , Herbert Road , Sandymount . There will be Suffrage speeches from well - known Suffrage speakers , and a dramatic entertainment will follow . Forthcoming Meetings . JULY 18 . London .

Mr. Asquith has been requested to receive depu- tations on the Suffrage question from several influential quarters this week . The Men's League has sent a memorial with this request , signed by Lord Lytton , Lord Courtney , the Bishop of Ken- sington , Rev. J. Adderley , Mr. Edward Carpenter , Sir W. Chance , the Dean of Worcester , Professor Herford , Mr. Henry Holiday , Sir Victor Horsley , Mr. Housman , Mr. Alymer Maude , Mr. W. de Morgan , Mr. Eustace Miles , Rev. W. Temple , Mr. Sidney Webb , Mr. Alfred Wallace , and many other well - known people . We are glad to note that they base their claim to be received on the ground that Mr. Asquith's pledge about the Franchise Bill has never been redeemed , though those to whom it was given " fruitlessly expended time and money " on the strength of it . The Federated Council of Suffrage Societies . The Federated Council has also asked the Prime Minister to receive a deputation , on the same grounds , and press for a Government measure as the only possible way of redeeming the pledges given . On being refused the proposed interview , Miss Broadhurst pointed out that the pledges had been given , not to the House of Commons , but to the Suffrage women of the country , who have received no answer whatever to their claim to be heard on this point . The W.S.P.U. a Mrs. Baines , her husband , and son , and Miss Wallwork were remandéd in Manchester on charge of having damaged certain railway_carriages . All were released on bail , except Mrs. Baines . Mrs. Rigby , charged in Liverpool with having caused an explosion under the flags of the Liverpool Exchange , confessed in Court that she was also responsible for burning Sir William Lever's house . She had given herself up of her own accord . Miss Annie Kenney was re - arrested after a meeting Mrs. Pankhurst at the Pavilion on July 14th . escaped in the tumult which was caused . The Tax Resistance League . Mrs. Kate Harvey , of Brackenhill , Bromley , bas barricaded her house and grounds against the tax- collector . She is also resisting the Insurance Act The Edinburgh Town Councillor and Electors Report . A " Town Councillors ' and Electors ' Deputation " to Mr. Asquith has had its request for an interview refused , but declares its intention of leaving for London on the 17th , notwithstanding . The deputa- tion declares itself to be " non - militant and non- party , " but the reports of the meeting held to consider Mr. Asquith's answer hardly bear out these claims . COPIES OF THE SERMON preached by the Rev. Canon Rawnsley in Crosthwaite Church on the Sunday that the Suffrage Pilgrims had assembled there , can be procured at sixpence half- penny each , including postage , from Mrs. John Marshall , Derwent Island , Keswick .

All Liberal women , and all Liberal women's associations , whether they belong to the Women's Liberal Federation , the Women's National Liberal Association , or to neither , are eligible for member- ship or affiliation on the one understanding that they do not work for Anti - Suffrage Liberal candi- dates until after the next General Election . The Union does not insist on any financial con- tribution as a condition of membership or affilia- tion . Naturally , however , the usefulness of the Union depends on the generosity of those who agree with its object and methods . All communications , inquiries , requests , and suggestions with be wel- come , and should be addressed to the Secretary , Miss F. Duncan , as above . Items of Interest . This week an appeal comes from Scarborough , calling upon any Suffragists who may be visiting the popular seaside resort to lend their assistance either at a stall , which is held in the Market every Thursday , from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. , or by speaking at the various meetings or selling the COMMON CAUSE on the sands . The office of the local branch of the N.U.W.S.S. , 6 , Falconer Chambers , is open daily from 11.30 to 12.30 , and on Monday and Thurs- day afternoons from 3 to 4. Those willing to help should communicate with the Secretary , Miss E. Stephens , 7 , Granville Square , Scarborough . News comes from Warrenton , Oregon , of Miss Clara Cynthia Munson , who was elected Mayor of Warrenton within one month after the passing of the amendment giving the women of Oregon the right to vote . Miss Munson is well versed in civic problems . Her father , J. W. Munson , was an Cregon pioneer of 1853 , and a lighthouse - keeper for over thirty years . To quote the Christian Science Monitor : " The long and lonely hours which are the accom- paniment of this occupation gave him much time for reading and studying politics , and as his daughter acted as his assistant during his late years she acquired a knowledge that is not often accorded to women , " There is in progress at present a most interest- ing exhibition in Amsterdam , which will last until October , and which should attract the attention of every woman . The exhibition has a special portion devoted to the arts and crafts in which women specially excel , such as needlework , house decora- tion , dressmaking , and cooking . The native women of the Dutch dependencies are also represented by fine handwork of great variety . Suffrage quarters are also established , and conferences regarding this all - important question are regularly held with noted speakers from different countries . In fact , this women's exhibition , which is managed by Dr. Mia Boisseevain , a well - known woman lawyer of Amster- dam , is a remarkable evidence of what they have achieved , and has attained an unequivocal and well- deserved success . The Annual Show of the Women's Agricultural and Horticultural International Union was held at the Royal Botanic Society , Regent's Park , on July 11th . Farm produce of all descriptions and variety was exhibited - poultry , both alive and ready for eating , eggs , butter , home - cured ham , flowers , fruit and vegetables , jams and bottled fruits , bore witness to the good domestic and business acumen of the women farmers . They realise they are doing good and valuable work , and pay particular atten- tion to the question of marketing ; they dispense as much as possible with the middleman's commission , and sell as much as they can to retail shops at prices competing keenly with Covent Garden . The Women Farmers have come to stay , if we can apply that term to a calling that takes its followers to the uttermost ends of the world . The increase of women guardians in England and Wales shows the difference between 1,536 in this year , as against 1,323 in last . The total number of guardians is about 25,000 . The Women's Local Government Society has been unremitting in its endeavours towards rousing interest within the area of those Poor Law Unions which had no women on their Board of Guardians . There were 235 of them , mostly rural , and last April fifty - five of the areas in question elected one or more women . The Society asks the aid of the press in appealing to the public for information regarding elections of women parish councillors . The number of Parish Councils in England and Wales being 7,213 , the cost of conducting a systematic inquiry is more than the Society can afford , and there are no official returns . as Dr. Marie C. Stopes has just been given the first lectureship in fossil botany recently established at the London University . The distinguished scientist . has a record unique in the annals of her sex . She was the first woman appointed to the scientific staff of Manchester University . The Royal Society en- trusted her with a coal investigating expedition to Japan in 1907 , when she visited parts entirely un- known to any previous European explorer . Dr. Stopes has also worked in Canada in connection with the Geological Survey . The Norwich Division of the British Medical Asso- ciation is being represented at the general meeting of the British Medical Association , at Brighton , on July 18th , by Dr. Mary Bell . News of this descrip- tion is always welcome to those interested in women's work and progress , and we congratulate Norwich on its unprejudiced action and Dr. Bell on the honour done her by the old city . and mention THE COMMON
