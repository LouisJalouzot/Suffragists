THE COMMON CAUSE , " MAY 5 , 1910 . The Common The Organ of the Women's VOL . II . No. 56 . Registered as MAY 5 a Newspapar . The News of the Week . What Women Want . At last the Budget is through , and it is time to make another . When we think of what the struggle has cost the unfortunate taxpayers - women as well as men - we might ( were we as unreasonable as some men we know ) cry : Why can't you men agree ? " But , of course , we don't do that . What interests us is to see whether men will again disagree about the women's demand , and offer them what no body of women has asked for , while deny- ing what the whole body of organized women Suffragists does ask for , the removal of the sex disability . A Point in Scots Law . A Scotch correspon- dent points out how different the municipal franchise is in Scotland to what it is in Eng- land . There , appar- ently , ownership carries with it the municipal vote ( which it does not in England ) , and mar- riage does not deprive a woman of her muni- cipal vote except where her husband is the tenant of the house which she owns . an instance , our cor- respondent quotes a lady who owns a house whose rent is about £ 100 , her husband being the tenant . For this she has no vote ; but in a back lane she owns stable , rent £ 16 , a As which is let to a grocer , and the lady has a vote for this . Immortal Bumble ! How often would we quote thee ! Training Cooks . Photo . by Elliott and Fry . MR . JOSEPH A correspondence has been going on in the " Daily News " concerning the proposed college for cooks which the L.C.C. apparently intends to open for boys only . Very naturally people are asking , " Why for boys only ? " Women need training in cookery , and it should be different according to whether they intend to take up high - class cookery as a trade in rich houses and hotels , or whether they are to be housekeepers in a poor home .

The Starvation Wage . By Mrs. Osler . Cause . Movement for Reform . , 1910 . ONE PENNY . In any case training is needed , and should be given , and it would be given if women had more say in the spending of public money . One correspondent objects that it is no use training women as domestic servants since English girls prefer factory work , the domestic conditions being so bad . We agree that they are often very bad , and such as no modern independent - minded young woman will , or ought to endure . But the remedy lies in raising the status of domestic service . Wages on the whole com- CLAYTON . pare favourably with women's wages in other work . It is the servile conditions that must be done away with . If domestic service could be organized , if women were trained and certi- ficated , and worked under just Trade Union rules , we should see a considerable return to what is healthy , neces- sary , and interesting work . A thoroughly trained and efficient girl could command reasonable conditions ; an untrained incom- petent can only drift about from place to place . The Supply of Teachers . Another very warm discussion has been tak- ing place in the Press concerning the supply of elementary school teachers , which is being artificially fostered by the Board of Education so that , in October last , there were actually 1,528 without employ- ment , and large num- bers of certificated teachers are work at the rates of unqualified teachers . taking The officers of the London Teachers ' Asso- ciation and the Presi- dent of the National Union of Teachers have protested strongly against the unwarranted optimism of the Board of Education . It is pointed out that the proper remedy is for the Board of Education to insist on the appointment of certified teachers , and to reduce the size of classes . This would be in the interests of the children , and would check a grave injus- tice to young persons who , having trained at public expense , may not take employment other than teaching , and can get no teaching employment .

50 Authority and Discipline . THE COMMON On the 17th ult . Mr. Belloc , M.P. , addressed some boys " There was in Salford upon " authority and discipline . " no virtue , " he said , in a citizen , or sailor , or workman who obeyed because he was told . Authority was good when there was a law which one obeyed without a loss of self - respect , when one was given an order by a superior and obeyed it without a diminution of self - respect . If the one obeyed because he who gave the order was stronger , then one was a slave . A society built up of men who obeyed because they had to was worthless . " Amen , say we . Does Mr. Belloc expect us to believe that men are the superiors of women in temperance ? in chastity ? in control of the passions ? That they are superior to them in the understanding of children ? of the needs of home life , health , and the race ? If not , how can Mr. Belloc imagine that women will keep their self - respect under the tyranny ( benevolent or other ) of men , because they are stronger ? And how in the name of reason can it be " grossly immoral " to wish to retain your self - respect ? What a pity we women can read Mr. Belloc's words of wisdom , even when they are addressed to boys ! Divorce in Norway . In many ways it would seem that Norway is greatly in advance of us . In a recent issue we had an article describing the juries on which women sit . Divorce is also obtainable in Norway by mutual consent , which seems rather more rational than our system of only giving it when one party objects or pretends to object . Also a woman can in Norway divorce her husband for the same causes as allow him to divorce her . Yet the rate is not nearly so high as in neighbouring countries , being only 54 per 100,000 of the population . The Problem of Existence . It isn't always easy , of course , to judge from a news- paper report what was the nature of a magistrate's remarks , and Mr. Plowden is so humane a man that we should like to believe the report we saw the other day of a dialogue between him and an applicant for a separa- tion in the Marylebone Court was not quite correct . Here , if we are to believe the report ( in the " Globe " ) , Mr : Plowden made merry over the application of a middle - aged little woman who said that her husband had been drunk nearly every night for two years , and had been guilty meanwhile of cruelty , threats , and abuse , and had failed to maintain her . Mr. Plowden is reported as having chaffed the woman , and as having suggested she should have pity " on a lost soul . " Meanwhile it is not suggested how the woman with five children is to live . Woman the Breadwinner . At a recent discussion of the Reigate Education Com- mittee a motion was brought forward by Mr. J. Powell , J.P .: That seeing that the head women teachers have to pass the same qualifying standard as the men , and are required to do similar teaching work and carry out similar duties , it is inequitable and unjust that they should be paid at a lower rate for their services . This Reigate Education Committee , therefore , resolves that the rate of head teachers ' salaries shall be the same for both . " The discussion showed the usual contradictory argu- ments , all directed to show that for opposite reasons women ought to be paid less than men . One speaker suggested that since women were not equal to the same physical strain as men , they must be paid less . That is to say , because they are weaker they must be less well fed , less well housed , and must never escape from the harassing fear of the future . We deny that women are less tough than men . We believe that their more fre quent absences from work , when established , are due to the cruel double demand of home and wage - earning , and to the fact that from childhood up they are under- fed as compared with their brothers . One man pointed out that we paid women their " market value " ; he omitted to say that we do this in a market rigged by men . Anether brought up the old , old plea that women had

CAUSE , MAY 5 , 1910 . Two only themselves to keep , and men had families . recent deaths in the Potteries illustrate this pious lie . One , Ann Hand , died of lead - poisoning - her husband was out of work , and she was the breadwinner for the family . The other , Ann Adams , also dying of lead - poisoning , had a mother and sister dependent on her . A bachelor can get a living wage on the assumption that he keeps a family , and if he remains a bachelor all his days and spends all his wage on himself and ruins innumerable poor women , he still gets the wage of the head of a family , while the woman must starve on a sweated wage and be told her work is inferior . Would not a half - starved man's work be inferior to that of a full - fed man ? The N.U.T. is getting on . With a few more women on its Executive we may hope to see it advocate equal wage for equal work . Unity or Duality ? Letter - writers in the " Church Times " have been busy justifying the English Church marriage service against One writer the attacks made on it by Lady McLaren . remarks : " May I add that the meaning of the woman's promise to obey seems often ill - understood . The great object is , not to assert inferiority , but to establish unity . " Of course there are different ways of establishing unity , and this one is like the historic case of the " young lady of Riga , " Who smiled as she rode on a tiger ; They returned from their ride With the lady inside , And the smile on the face of the tiger . " Another writer explains that when the man says , " with all my worldly goods I thee endow , " he actually does so , because in law a woman may pledge her husband's credit according to his means . We know the law says so , but the poor woman as a matter of fact often finds it impossible to accomplish this , and can only extract her due maintenance by becoming a pauper ; moreover , by our beautiful English law a man may make a will by which he leaves his wife penniless , even when she has borne him children , and is left to support them . It's a precarious sort of endowment , and the sort of " unity " arrived at does not work out so well for the woman as a frank admission of and provision for duality . Are Women Laymen ? " Not long ago in Melbourne , a lady , Miss Job , from Queenstown , Tasmania , sat " within the bar " at a Wes- leyan Methodist Conference . One minister protested that the annual conference was composed of ministers and laymen , and they had not power to admit " the best lady in Victoria " ; but others , including the President , held that " laymen " included women , and Miss Job took her seat within the bar amid vigorous applause . Australian Elections . we At the recent Federal elections in Australia hear that women voted in large numbers , and then , as before , voted in the various parties in much the same pro- portions as men . The Logical Frenchman . La Lanterne of the 23rd April has an interesting leader upon the position of women in France . It is founded upon the very favourable report of M. Buisson , of which mention was made in our issue of last week , and it con- cludes with these words : If women teachers have the right to the university vote , if women in trade have the right to the commercial vote , if working women have the right to the industrial vote , how can we refuse to women who pay to municipal and national funds the correspond- ing electoral rights ? How , indeed ? But Englishmen seem wonderfully content to admit that women ought to have that which men nevertheless continue to withhold . Our Portrait . We introduce to our readers this week Mr. Joseph Clayton , who we hope will shortly be M.P. for South Salford ,

Baretti 57 Reviews 57 Correspondence 57 Reports of Societies 59 Forthcoming Meetings 63 One - Sex Liberalism . As announced in last week's issue , another step has been taken by the National Union in the direction of more effectually securing friends in the House and keeping out enemies . " It has always been the policy of the Union to support noted supporters and oppose noted opponents , and it has also been long ago recognized that the best way of opposing one man is to run another against him . Although opposition by speech and writing may and does do something , there is no doubt it is a much harder thing to get an elector to vote against all his other principles and on the issue of Women's Suffrage alone , than to persuade an elector to choose , between two candidates of the same political colour , the one who , on the question of the enfranchisement of women , represents justice to The National Union has now approved the adoption of Mr. Joseph Clayton as prospective Inde- pendent Women's Suffrage candidate for South Salford . women . " 33 The situation in South Salford is this . The sitting member , Mr. Hilaire Belloc , M.P. , is entirely opposed to Women's Suffrage . While speaking freely on the advantages of liberty , of self - government , of taxation by the People , and all the other benefits to be derived from " Liberal " principles , he denies to women any share in these benefits , characterizes the agitation for the vote as grossly immoral " ( because it would " alter the relations of the sexes " ) , and , when challenged to give reasons , refuses to answer a woman and declares that the subject becomes more unsavoury daily . Suffragists have felt that it was impossible to sit down under such coarse and cowardly imputations , and it was not unnatural for them to suppose that the Salford Liberals would them- selves call their Member to account for his silly utter- ances ; that they would themselves protest against one- sex Liberalism . They have chosen not to do so , while , many of them , expressing disagreement with Mr. Belloc . The North of England Society , which has been working in South Salford for months past , and which has con- ducted negotiations with local Liberals , has given them ample warning . During the last General Election the Suffragists protested against Mr. Belloc's attitude and held large meetings , at which resolutions condemning him were passed very heartily . More recently representations

CAUSE 51 were made to the South Salford Liberal Association , and it was pointed out to them that the National Union had no hostility to the Liberal party , and that if the South Salford Liberals would choose a Suffragist candidate he would be supported ; if , however , after due warning , they persisted in running an Anti - Suffragist , the National Union would run an Independent candidate and defeat Mr. Belloc . The South Salford Committee replied that they could not see their way to meeting the Suffragists ' request .. The next step , therefore , was to secure a prospective candidate , and this has been done . Mr. Belloc's majority at the last election was 316. On many points he is an unpopular candidate for such a constituency as South Salford , where his de haut en bas style of speaking does not endear him to a working - class population . What South Salford wants , and will be glad to have , is a man who understands labour , who will come down among the people and learn their needs and opinions , so that he may truly represent them in the House . We choose Mr. Mr. Clayton will do this . Clayton , of course , because he is a Suffragist and will stand to represent the women's need for enfranchisement , which he believes to be the most crying need of the day . But we do not wish merely to get Mr. Belloc out : we wish and we intend to get our candidate in , and to do that it is necessary to choose one who will appeal to the electors more than Mr. Belloc does . The interests and the character of the electors of South Salford have been constantly in the minds of those who made the selection , and they are satisfied that Mr. Clayton far more closely identifies himself with the interests of these electors than their sitting Member . The South Salford Liberal Committee have made a great blunder . Their Member , should he stand for re- election is certain to be defeated : the labour vote will secure this . Every man , therefore , who cares to get into the House an Anti - Veto representative rather than a Con- servative , will vote for Mr. Clayton rather than waste his vote on a lost man like Mr. Belloc . « Of course , we are scolded by some party Liberals who can see nothing beyond the blinkers of party - discipline . looks like vin- They tell us that to oppose Mr. Belloc dictiveness . " Vindictive ! The notion of women as animated door - mats is so rooted in some minds that it is considered vindictive for them to protest against their cry for liberty being stigmatized as " grossly immoral " ! They tell us that Women's Suffrage is a Liberal prin- ciple , " and therefore , apparently , we are to support a " Liberal " who denies this " principle . " ! They tell us that " at this crisis we ought to refrain from hampering And Liberals . But it is always a crisis for party men . we did refrain at the last General Election . What is our reward ? In spite of long patience and fair warning , they persist in supporting our enemy . Now we have found a man for whom true Liberals can vote : we fight no Liberal principle , we fight only the cruel and illiberal party machine . No man who votes for Mr. Clayton need deny his political faith ; our man is more liberal than " He who's for us , for him are we ! " the Liberal . " Men's Opportunity . " " For some time past we have had a sympathetic majority in the House of Commons for Women's Suffrage , and the average man is now converted to the justice of the demand for admitting women to full citizen- ship . ( Of course , there are still a certain number of old- fashioned and reactionary persons of the male sex who would deny political rights to women , and these men are generally tiresome in private life and mischievous in public . But they are a diminishing number , and Parlia- ment will soon know them no more ) . The question is , what is the sympathy of men worth in the Women's Cause ? Take the House of Commons first . Here the difficulty is to get the thoroughly sincere Women's Suffragist to take a strong line or make a definite stand . He admits , to the full , the present injustice , and would like to see it remedied . But First , the claims of party are strong , and nothing must be done that would embarrass his party in the House , Then , there are so many other

52 COMMON THE important questions in which the M.P. is deeply interested ( and he forgets that no satisfactory settlement of these questions is possible while women are denied a voice in the settlement ) . So the good Suffragist M.P. is content to let the women wait ; for , after all , having no votes , they cannot worry him with their wrongs , as male electors can . That women are now by no means content to wait , members of Parliament are beginning to realise with feelings of perplexity and annoyance . That the wonderful patience of generations of women has of late yielded to open impatience is distinctly a matter of offence to most Members . " You have waited so long , why not " We are all go on waiting ? " says our sympathetic M.P. in favour of Women's Suffrage . What more can y u want ? " And just because politicians seem unable to understand that the vote , and nothing but the vote , is what is wanted , and that all the sympathy in the world won't make up for the denial of the vote , it is full time a few men were sent to the House of Commons who would stand for Women's Enfranchisement first and last , and all the time ; men who would contend for this great reform , in season and out of season , and without consult- ing the convenience of party whips . One or two Members , directly elected to voice that public opinion which is in earnest for Women's Enfranchisement , could quickly turn passive sympathy into active effort , and the House of Commons would , at length , realise that Women's Suffrage is no longer a matter of academic interest , but a burning question demanding immediate attention . For very shame Liberal politicians would have to cease from talking about an issue of Peers v . People if we had one M.P. who would point out plainly that while women are voteless the issue is only between Peers and Male Electors . It would be equally difficult for Tariff Reformers to talk about " the country " supporting their programme if it was dinned into their ears on the floor of the House of Commons that without Women's Enfranchisement " the country " was merely an inaccurate description of male voters . " The Labour Party , with all the good will in the world , and with all the honest purpose to represent the mass of " the labouring people , can never adequately represent people while women are excluded from citizenship . They are aware of this , and , to their credit , Labour Members have always supported Women's Suffrage . But Labour Members , like others , are apt to think their electors are " the people , " and to forget the non - electors . A Suffragist M.P. , by the constant reminder that " the people " were still only half represented , might reason- ably count on the honesty of the Labour Party to deter- mine that popular representation i.e. , the repre- sentation of men and women equally - was quickly made a reality . So much advantage to the Women's Cause is , then , to be gained by direct representation in Parliament . Can anything better be done to arouse the average man to action than a Parliamentary candidature ? The average man ( always excepting , as we said before , a handful of opponents who hold out - of - date views ) is convinced of the justice of Women's Suffrage . But , hitherto , he has been , in the main , rather an onlooker of the battle . He thinks women ought to have the vote , and hopes they'll get it , but is not inclined to do much to help them . It is true , with our Men's Leagues for Women's Suffrage we have done something to show that plenty of men resent the denial of the vote to women ; but still most men don't know what they can do to show they mean business in the matter . A Parliamentary candidature gives men the chance to show that their sympathy means something . It is not enough to turn out an enemy of Women's Suffrage . It is time men proved their faith . By running independent candidates for Parliament the women of the North of England give fresh proof of their intense earnestness for the Franchise , and make a fresh appeal to English man- hood . There is only one answer for men to make to this appeal . We believe in the justice of the demand ; at the ballot box men can demonstrate their belief as a living faith . Government by the consent of the governed is the theory of English political justice . In the last hundred

CAUSE . MAY 5 , 1910 . years we have seen the removal of disabilities from the Catholic and the Jew and the Freethinker . Catholics declined to be represented by their Protestant fellow- countrymen and obtained emancipation . The Jew was admitted to Parliament when the City of London declared that to be a Hebrew was no ground for political disabilities . The workmen obtained the franchise , and after some years followed this by sending their own spokesmen to Parliament when they decided that the employer and the landlord could not well represent them . To - day it is the women of England who cannot at all consent to be governed without a vote in the choosing of governors . The Catholic has been emancipated . The Jew and the Freethinker have been admitted to Parliament without questioning their religious beliefs . The labouring man has been admitted to full citizenship . There is only the removal of sex - disability left . It is to our national discredit that women have been denied the vote so long . It must be to the credit of the present generation that this injustice is abolished . To obtain that abolition as quickly as possible let us elect a few Suffragist Members of Parliament . JOSEPH CLAYTON . Why Women Need the Vote . VII . The Starvation Wage . Let us begin by impressing on our minds two salient facts : ( 1 ) That there are computed to be four to five million women wage - earners in our country to - day ; ( 2 ) that these women , even when doing the same work as men , and doing it equally well , are seldom paid more than from half to two - thirds the wages of men . This holds good of nearly all occupations , from the higher grades - e.g . , teachers , inspectors , clerks , and the like- to the factory hand . Where men inspectors are paid £ 400 to £ 800 , women discharging the same duties receive £ 200 to £ 400 . In factories , for identically the same work with the same machines , men are paid 30s . to 40s . , and women 18s . at most , the average being lower . Evidence was given before the Fair Wages Commission concerning payment for certain stitching on riding saddles , to the effect that you cannot tell whether it has been done by a man or a woman . The men were slower at the work than the women , yet the men received 9s . 6d . for work which took them twelve hours , and the women 4s . 6d . for the same work done in ten hours . The rate in the one case was 91d . per hour , in the other 5d . C " For the most part it is accepted as right and natural that women should be employed only in the inferior and worst - paid departments of all trades ; a Trade Union official explained that women would not be allowed to do a certain trade process , because the 36s . earned at the work is " too good money for women . " It is sometimes stated that men are paid higher on the supposition that they maintain a family : if any such basis were really adopted , the difference should be made , not between one sex and the other , but between married and unmarried , and between young men and women living at home with their parents , and those compelled to rely only on them- selves . The argument might apply to a social condition where all women were supported by all men ; but is assuredly not applicable to facts as they exist . Nothing arouses such anger among the opponents of Women's Suffrage as any assumption that the possession of the vote would improve women's wages . Certainly prophecy is a weak weapon unless based on experience ; but the grounds for our expectation are these . Wages depend on three main factors : ( 1 ) Demand and supply ; ( 2 ) organisation ; ( 3 ) status of workers . The first we may treat as common to both sexes ; the second has unques- tionably been a powerful lever in forcing up men's wages ; at present it is of little use to women , because without money they cannot organise , and without organisation they cannot obtain more money . It is a vicious circle . In the one trade where women do receive equal pay for equal work ( cotton spinning ) , they belong to the same

MAY 5 , 1910 . COMMON THE union as the men and reap the benefit of their united power ; but in the majority of trades filled by women , they are too poor to combine effectively . A woman work- ing for a starvation wage ( their average pay is 7s . 6d . ) cannot afford even the few weekly pence necessary for membership of a union . Experience , however , shows that a rise of status among workers may have the same effect as organisation . Trade Unionism among agricultural labourers has never been comparable in strength to that among town artisans , yet since their enfranchisement their wages have greatly increased . As voters , they have become a power to be reckoned with and considered . We must also bear in mind the decreasing reluctance of Government to inter- vene in the labour market for the purpose of securing a living wage to workers . Once this right of intervention is admitted , the connection between votes and wages becomes a very practical one , and is illustrated by the recent Trades Board Act , by means of which the starva- tion wages of the nail and chain makers have been actu- ally doubled . When this achievement was announced by Miss McArthur ( to whom the credit for it is largely due ) to a great gathering of the women workers , they are said to have laughed incredulously , crying out that it was too good to be true . Our opponents , of course , will rejoin , " See what can be done without the vote ! " No one has ever denied that reforms have been and can be achieved without it ; but that is no reason why the labour of agita- NATIONAL UNION OF WOMEN'S OBJECT : To obtain the Parliamentary franchise for women METHODS : ( a ) The promotion of the claim of women to the all constitutional methods of agitation in the country non - party basis .

I suggested that immediate action be taken by them to induce members to promise in addition to what they already give 1s . per month to this fund societies let me know what action , if any , they are taking to secure this amount ? ( 3 ) I drew attention to the resolution passed by the Council at its annual meeting , calling upon the Execu- tive and the affiliated societies to consider the possibility of running Women's Suffrage candidates in suitable con- stituencies and to prepare the ground ; and I reminded those who dictated and laid down this policy that it could only be carried out by means of their hearty co - opera- tion and financial support . Since those words were written barely a month ago -events have moved with startling rapidity . For some weeks the North of England Society has been breaking up ground in South Salford with a view to opposing the return to Parliament of Mr. Hilaire Belloc , who is a strong opponent of the enfranchisement of women - going so far even as to describe the Women's Suffrage agitation as an " immoral movement . " Now it is announced that not only is ground being pre- pared , but a prospective candidate has been secured in the person of Mr. Joseph Clayton - a member of the Men's League , -who is prepared to come forward as an independent Women's Suffrage candidate , his candidature having been approved by the Executive Committee of the National Union . It is probable that the name of another prospective candidate and another constituency will shortly be announced . The policy of the Union is being carried out ; and I now call upon our affiliated societies and all friends who approve of our methods to stand by their policy and find the funds necessary to carry it to a successful issue . All contributious sent in to our war chest for this purpose will be earmarked for , and solely devoted to , the running of independent Women's Suffrage candidates at the next general election , which it seems likely may take place in July . Therefore there is no time to lose . The funds for this special work must be in before the dissolution takes place . I look forward with confidence to a generous response to my appeal as soon as the need for it is before the readers of " Common Cause BERTHA MASON , Treasurer , to whom all contributions should be sent , addressed to National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies ' Office , Parliament Chambers , Great Smith Street , Westminster , S.W. Forming Federations . 27 We have described the various bodies forming the organisation of the Union and the various meetings which they are to hold during the year . We propose in this article to suggest a few points for consideration in the federating of societies within defined areas . A certain amount of work has already been informally done by some of the larger societies or by the National Union . For instance , London may be said to be the centre of a densely populated although hitherto undefined * area . 35 In the London Society , the branches or committees have been counted in the membership and representation of the Society , but have not had complete autonomy ; in the North of England Society , on the other hand , the branches have complete autonomy and control over their finances , but they have not been counted in the repre- sentation . In the Yorkshire and the Surrey , Sussex , and Hants organisations , the link has been formed by a National Union organiser . In Scotland the movement for federation has taken on a national character . The rules laid down for the forming of Federations are very few , and it was felt that the greatest possible latitude should be allowed in the internal arrangements of the federating societies . The Federations can only be formed of societies affiliated to the National Union , and once the area of a Federation is defined , the societies within that area can only federate with other societies in that area . When certain societies have agreed together

It is important for the national work that there should not be any no - man's - land between Federations , and also that , wherever possible , there should be at least one strong existing society as a kind of centre and rallying point for each Federation . We are inclined to think that better work is done where the area is not too large , yet the convenience of getting societies federated quickly is so obvious that we should think it better to have the areas rather large at first and divide them up later , as funds increase and societies multiply . In selecting the area to be covered by one Federation due regard must be paid to convenience of railway com- munication , since it must be remembered that there will have to be frequent committee meetings . Care should also be taken that the area should cover whole constitu- encies , since it would be found very awkward , in working , that a constituency should be half in one Federation and half in another . The headquarters , where committees are held , may be moveable , but there is no doubt that where it can possibly be afforded , a permanent office and paid secretary should be secured . Without these the work will always be very small . Representatives from all the societies in the proposed area should be summoned to determine these questions and also to select a name for the Federation , to arrange the question of its finances , to elect a committee and officers , two representatives for the year to sit on the Provincial Council and a representative from the Execu- tive Committee of the National Union to sit on the Federation Committee . As soon as all these details have been settled and a great effort should be made to get all the societies in the area to join , the proposed Federation should send up its scheme for approval to the Executive Committee of the National Union . Next week we hope to describe some of the work to be done by Federations . The By - Elections . SOUTH EDINBURGH . Polling Day : April 29th . C. H. Lyell ( L ) R. C. Glyn ( U ) Liberal majority 8,694 6,367 2,327 The by - election is now over , and we can congratulate our- selves that Women's Suffrage has been kept well before the electors . The candidates have been heckled at almost all meetings . In answer to a direct question , Mr. Lyell has admitted that he is an adult Suffragist . He will not oppose any fur- ther extension of the franchise to men which does not include women . His support , therefore , is not of much value to us , as he would obviously vote for a manhood Suffrage Bill , if such a Bill came before the House of Commons . We find that both Mr. Dewar and Mr. Lyell have done our cause some harm among the working - men in Edinburgh by their reiterated statements that we are asking for votes for pro- pertied women only . Mr. Lyell has said that he would not approve of any Bill for Woman's Suffrage unless it enfran- chised " Working - men's Wives . " This has made it difficult for us to convince the electors that a very large proportion of those to be enfranchised would be working - women . There is also another difficulty . To the man in the street , all those working for the Suffrage appear to be rich women or women of the leisured classes . They find it difficult to believe that we want the vote for the benefit of our country and in order to help our poorer sisters . These two points have come up repeatedly at our outdoor meetings . During the four days of this week we have addressed twenty meetings in Edin- burgh . If we had had the full time of the speakers avail- able , we could have held a larger number of meetings , but Dr. Inglis , Dr. Hutcheson , and Miss Macmillan are all very busy women , and could only give us part of their time . The best dinner - hour meeting we held was at Bertram's Engineer- ing Works , where about 200 men listened to me , afterwards asking most intelligent questions . They told me they had heckled both candidates about Women's Suffrage , and when I departed they gave a ringing cheer . They had been thoroughly convinced at the General Election by Miss Abadam . Mr. Sandison , who had previously heckled Mr. Lyell at a public meeting , did so again when he came to

MAY 5 , 1910 . THE COMMON address the men at a dinner - hour meeting . Thus , at two dinner - hour meetings , as well as at all his public meetings , Mr. Lyell has been made to see that the working - men acknow- ledge the justice of our demand , and are going to help us . The night before an election is one when political rowdyism is at its height . Miss Lisa Gordon , Miss Hilliard , and I had an exciting experience . We choose a stand at Ardmillan Terrace , where we had previously held excellent meetings , and Miss Gordon began to speak from a cab . An organized band of boys gathered round and endeavoured , by constant shouting , to drown the speaker's voice . A football " train came into the neighbouring station , and several hundred men joined our crowd . They were interested , wished to hear , and yet said they could do nothing to stop the children , who threw a good many articles at us , such as tomatoes and carrots . They got under the cab and tried to upset it . They attempted to shut up the back of the cab so as to throw the speaker down , but Miss Hilliard , with the help of two lads , kept them back , while the by - standers from behind urged us to " use the whip to them . " Finally , after half an hour of this , a Unionist meeting began close by , and the greater number of the children departed . The men closed in , and it became possible for Miss Gordon to make herself heard . At this juncture some fireworks were thrown into and under the cab . The cabman said he dared not risk the horse , which was already terrified at the din , so most un- willingly we had to depart . We went to Morningside Station , where we held a good meeting . Miss Dorothy Kirkwood sold three dozen " Common Causes " in the street that evening . She is a very good saleswoman , and we wish others would follow her example . Among our hecklers we wish especially to thank Mr. Shaw , Mr. Campbell , Mr. Sandison , Mr. Somer- ville , Miss Hilliard , and Miss Lisa Gordon . man . Miss F. Matheson and Miss Hilliard have both made suc- cessful débuts as outdoor speakers , as also did Miss Good- Miss Moody is a capital helper , and assisted at a meet- ing every evening during the election . Miss Mackirdy , Miss Kirkwood , and Miss Ross also helped us . With more speakers we could have done more ; but still , as it was , among street speakers women were in a decided majority . A. Low . CREWE . Mr. W. S. B. McLaren ( L. ) Mr. J. H. Welsford ( C. ) 7,639 6,041 1,598 Liberal majority The Crewe election is now over . We were not sure of a good reception ; we were almost led to expect some opposition , and we ended by being the most popular outside organization . The cheers given for " the suffrage ladies " when our decorated brake showed itself in the market square on the eve of the poll were deafening . The good reception we got was undoubtedly due to the splendid work of the North of England Society , which had worked up Crewe at the general election . I should like to be allowed to give my heartiest thanks to it and to the Birming- ham Society for the invaluable work they did during this election . Most of the speakers came from the North of England . Miss Robertson's eloquence drew large crowds , and Miss Bright was with us the whole time . Miss McHardy , an indefatigable worker from Birmingham , and Miss Walford , also from Birmingham , joined us in the last week's fight . Miss Stone came from Hampstead , and did all the hard , disagreeable work a non - speaker has to do . No sort of weather interfered with her self - imposed duties . Miss Phillips proved an impossible nut to crack for the Tariff Reformers who lost their audiences when she began her dinner - hour meetings . Early and late we were at it . Meetings were held all over the constituency ; all our halls were packed , and we had to have overflow meetings outside . In one instance we had a better - filled hall than the candidate himself . That our work has been more than effective we know from the fact that the Conservatives have taken the trouble to come into our committee - room , and have repeatedly asked us to modify our support ; and so much has our " intrusion " into the constituency on behalf of Mr. McLaren been resented that the one and only local Conservative paper in a leader note accuses us of " unfairness . " Mr. Welsford was , in their opinion , quite good enough . We have taken that as a great compliment . We were also in the same paper accused of being " politicians " and " tacticians . " Members of the Executive Committee have come down to speak . We have had Mrs. Stanbury , Miss Palliser , Mr. McLaren , Miss Ashton , and Mrs. Swanwick ; so no wonder we were repeatedly told " no party could beat the ladies in speaking . Mr. Crawfurd came over from Liverpool and spoke at two meetings . None could after that be afraid of losing their manliness if they openly supported us . " The Common Cause " with its topical pictures has sold very well , and has been much appreciated . Some of our friends put the portrait of Priscilla Bright McLaren in the window next to that of her son .

We hope the spirit of Meredith may forgive us Federation Work . HELGA GILL . At a meeting of the Yorkshire Organization Committee held on April 30 , the scheme for the Federation of Societies passed at the Council was laid before the committee , and , was enthusiastically adopted by them . It was thought that owing to the vastness of the area of Yorkshire , it might be found desirable to form two Federa- tions namely , ( 1 ) The North and East Ridings , ( 2 ) The West Riding . Great readiness was shown to follow up the pro- posals laid down by the National Union Annual Council . Miss E. Bateson and Mrs. Kirk , the hou . secretary and hon . treasurer , were re - elected respectively to serve under the new constitution without votes . Mrs. Bauer was elected as chairman . Mrs. Meyer ( York ) and Miss E. Bateson ( hon . secretary ) were elected to serve on the Provincial Council for the first year . A meeting of representatives of all societies now forming the Surrey , Sussex , and Hants . Organization was convened on Friday last , at which a resolution was unanimously passed in favour of the S.S. and H.O. Societies forming themselves into a Federation . Other societies within the area of the S.S. and H. are also considering the question of entering into a Federation with these societies . This Federation , if approved by the Executive of the National Union , will exist under a different name from that rather unwieldy one borne by the Surrey , Sussex , and Hants . , though we shall let it pass away with many regrets . The rules defining the constitution of this Federation , its hon . officers and financial position , were drawn up , and at the earliest opportunity will be presented to the Executive Com- mittee of the National Union for its approval . When once this Federation is formed we hope it will include the other societies within its area . For , generally speaking , all societies desiring to extend their membership within their area or to extend Suffrage beyond their area will be well advised to join a convenient Federation . Societies will do well to remember that if they do not join the Federation , they will be unrepresented at the Provincial Councils , which are probably going to be a force for education and expansion in Suffrage work . My Visit to Ireland . My three days ' visit to Ireland was a busy and happy one , crowded with engagements of one kind or another . Wednesday morning was given over to a visit to Trinity College , whither I was taken by Mrs. Haslam , and over which I was shown by Miss Gwynne , the warden of the women's department . Under her kindly guidance I saw the women's rooms , the beautiful library rich in many literary treasures , the dining - hall , and the kitchen . The afternoon found me at the private house of Miss White , Principal of the Alexandra College for Girls , who had kindly invited friends interested in Women's Suffrage and education to meet me at tea . After an enjoyable hour I was taken over the College buildings , in which I found much to interest me . In the evening dinner and an " At Home " at the lics- pitable house of Mrs. Townshend , the daughter of the late Chevalier Bunsen , gave me an opportunity , much appreciated , of meeting many friends interested in the Suffrage movement , who are keeping the Suffrage torch alight in their beautiful Emerald Island . Thursday morning was devoted to an all too brief visit to the National Museum under the kindly guidance of Pro- fessor Oldham . A short visit to Mrs. Haslam , who gave me much information concerning the Suffrage work in Dublin from the early days of the movement up to the present time , was followed by lunch by the kind invitation of Mrs. Hogg , wife of the Rt . Hon . Jonathan Hogg , at their pleasant house outside Dublin . In the evening I gave my lecture at the Leinster Hall to a large audience . The arrangements for the , meeting were excellent , made and carried out under the personal supervision of Mrs. Haslam , whose enthusiasm and activity , despite the weight of 81 years carried very lightly , worthy of the imitation of all younger workers in the Suffrage movement . -are over which I was taken by Major Fuge , the head of the The following morning found me at the Labour Exchange , system for the whole of Ireland , whose acquaintance , and that of his charming American wife I had made on my arrival .

In January last the Hungarian W.S.A. resolved to initiate an international movement to express sympathy with the Finnish nation , and to protest against the action of Russia , which threatens to suppress the Finnish nationality by violence . Finland was the first European nation which enfranchised its women , and Suffragists in Hungary accord- ingly felt it was not sufficient that women should merely feel sympathy ; it was the moment to come forward and to offer moral support to a country where so great an injustice is threatened . Copies of the resolutions were accordingly for- warded to the secretaries of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance , suggesting that every possible effort should be made to call attention to the danger which was overshadowing Finland , particularly by the summoning of meetings , at which men and women of all classes and parties should unite in a protest against the tyrannous plans of Russia . The movement has not met with unanimous support , some societies intimating that they considered it a wiser course not to interfere with the internal affairs of other nations . Sweden and the Netherlands refuse to comply with the request from Hungary , quoting a bye - law by which the Alliance pledges itself to observe absolute neutrality on all questions strictly national . GERMANY . A conference was held in March in Berlin to discuss the interests and position of the German working woman . After the protests and manifestations roused by the electoral reform proposed by the Prussian Diet , the meeting may be considered as oil upon troubled waters . The Association has now been working for over four years with ever - increasing success and widening sphere of influence , and members of all degrees of political and religious convictions are united on this question of reform , hoping that in the near future new laws will be passed which will materially better the conditions under which women work . After careful investigations two of the principal speakers agreed that the marked increase in women's labour ( a condi- tion proved by statistics ) is , under the existing circumstances , really detrimental to the race . The following reasons were advanced by Miss H. Simon in support of her theory : - ( 1 ) The number of women workers has increased , but this only applies to unskilled trades ; it does not mean that the mass of women are becoming skilled workers . ( 2 ) The women workers , therefore , only tend to vie with men in unskilled trades . ( 3 ) It is the old cry of the same and equal work at less pay , because the worker is a woman . ( 4 ) During the last fifteen years the number of married women working in factories has very largely increased , and under the present regulations this is a serious menace to the home . Dr. Marie Braun echoed the remarks of the previous speaker , and drew the following conclusions : - ( 1 ) That immediate reform was highly necessary , and if properly carried out by the State , with competent individual assistance , it would be of the highest value to the workers , both present and future . ( 2 ) That it was merely because openings and opportuni- ties were lacking that the woman's sphere of work was con- fined to the unskilled trades . In short , both speakers advocated fewer workers but better labour , and also the protection of motherhood . The latter point raised some discussion : one section considered that married women should be excluded from factory work , and the other that no difference should be made between married and single women . The question of how the general level of woman's work should be improved also occupied the meeting for a con- siderable time , and continuation and technical schools called forth much comment . The most important speeches delivered at this conference have been published in pamphlet form , and the promoters may be congratulated on the success of the meeting . To make woman become an individual worker - not merely one of a mass , that is the object which , it is hoped , they may soon achieve . SERVIA . The recent meeting organised by the Servian W.S.S. adequately proved that the cause has gained a sure hold upon the country . It was the first meeting at which all the various societies from different parts of the country were represented , and the large audience listened to excellent speeches by the president and vice - president . The latter gave a brief résumé of the political situation of their country , and urged the meeting to unite forces in order to stand up for national rights . Several questions of civil law were then brought for- ward , and clauses of the code , degrading to women , were discussed at some length . It was finally decided to secure for women their rightful position in society ; to work for the abolition of the husband's guardianship over his wife , and for a Married Woman's Property Act . An animated discus-

MAY 5 , 1910 . THE COMMON sion was provoked by the reading of the international report , great interest being shown in the position of the cause in other countries . ITALY . " In necessariis unitas , in dubiis libertas , in omnibus charitas . " These striking words , which those who attended the Council meeting last month may remember were quoted by Mrs. Broadley Reid in her short , effective speech , form the motto of the Suffragio Femminile in Italy , and are printed on the official postcard of the Comitato , with its beautiful symbolic design of a cup surrounded by a circle . Unity is perhaps the most emphatic characteristic of the movement in Italy . No party feeling weakens the efforts of the Italian women to secure the vote . Donna Giacinta Mar- tini , President of the Comitato Nazionale pro Suffragio Femminile , with whom the writer lately had the pleasure of an interview , a pioneer worker and a keen enthusiast in the movement , emphasises the value of this essential unity , for lack of which the women of Great Britain are handicapped to - day . Until the agitation for the abolition of sex disability began , Italian women took little , if any , part in politics . There are no associations in Italy corresponding to our different women's party organisations , and there is therefore none of that tenacious party feeling which is apt to com- plicate matters for us in Great Britain . Politically , women in Italy are working wholly and solely for the vote , with a concentration of force which must carry them rapidly forward , and is not unlikely to bring them to the goal of political enfranchisement before their sisters in Great Britain . It was only in 1906 that the National Women's Suffrage Society was formed in Italy , although smaller organised societies had been working for some time previous for the suffrage . The movement gained the first public and en- thusiastic recognition of the women of Italy at the National Council of Italian Women held at Rome in 1908 , when resolution was put and carried , almost unanimously , calling upon the Government to give the administrative and political vote to women . While receiving sympathetic and general recognition from Parliament , in which the Socialist party are their strong supporters , the Italian women have yet no organised body of male supporters such as our Men's League ; and Donna Giacinta Martini is particularly interested in that League , believing that a similar association in Italy would be most beneficial to the movement . We hope to hear soon that a Men's League has been formed in Italy , and we feel sure that when once started , such co - operation , with the keen intelli- gence and quick response to what is genuine which is such a noticeable feature of the Italian character , will give a great impetus and strength to the already rapid progress of that movement for the enfranchisement of women which , to quote from the concluding words of the " Petizione delle Donne Italiane , " has been " brought about by the law of evolution , which will not allow women to be any longer sacrificed on the cross of sex exclusion . " Troublesome Questions . MARGERY ( aged 19 ) . HER BROTHER . M. H. J. H. MARGERY : I suppose if Mrs. Jones gets her husband's work she will get just the same pay as he did ? HER BROTHER : Doesn't follow . Most likely not . MARGERY : Why not ? HER BROTHER : Well , women never are paid as much as men , you know . MARGERY : Why not ? HER BROTHER : Men have more expenses ; have to keep a wife and family , of course . MARGERY : Oh ! ( thoughtfully ) . But Mrs. Jones will have to keep her husband and family . And nurse her husband into the bargain . HER BROTHER : My dear girl , you can't make rules to fit every case . What has that to do with her employers ? MARGERY : But they pay men more because I say , I've thought of a way . Supposing men were paid the same as women till the day they married ! Then the money saved could be used to pay Mrs. Jones and people like her as much as a married man ! Miss Horniman's Theatre . There is scarcely any sort of play which this excellent company acts with more gusto and abandon than one which parodies theatrical art . We remember Mr. Esmé Percy's rollicking performance of the " Knight of the Burning Pestle , " and he infused something of the same wild humour into his playing of the Governor of Tilbury Fort in Sheridan's " Critic , " which is being repeated this week at the Manchester Gaiety .

To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , As one fully in sympathy with your remark that " We sincerely hope that the time is not far distant when to produce a dozen children and bury half of them will be considered disgraceful , " allow me to protest against the publication of Mrs. Sidney Webb's letter , in which she sup- ports the pernicious theory that circumstances requiring skilled aid at childbirth are " emergencies " comparable to those in which the police requisition the services of a doctor- e.g. , a street accident . We are told that such variations from the normal occur in " thousands . " We know that the patient has nine months in which to make preparation for such an " emergency " ! To my mind such teaching is on a par with the doctrine that an all - wise Providence " sends the little babies " quite irrespective of the fact that there will be little or nothing to sustain the heaven - sent gift when it arrives .

58 THE COMMON If a working man is unable to give his wife 7d . per week to pay the 21s . which is the average doctor's fee for such emergencies , " it is hardly likely that the child stands much chance of being properly brought up when it does come ; and I submit that if we admit the right of the State to step in and say that a child of school age must be fed and must have medical attention , it is only logical for it to insist that no child must be exposed at birth and immediately after to what may cause danger to life . It is the duty of the State to interfere , and probably the Poor Law is the best form of intervention . Because this service has up to now always concerned itself with the desti- tute there is no reason why it should not in the future deal with others of the poor who do not come under this heading . The fact that it is " relief under the Poor Law " will in all likelihood keep people from applying for medical aid who can perfectly well afford to pay for it , but who would shirk this unpleasant responsibility were it not for " the relieving officer and his hated inquiries . " Those of us who have had experience of police cases know how difficult it is for the officers ever to obtain payment from those who have received emergency " medical aid . Curiously enough it would appear that those who are run over or knocked down by bicycles are almost invariably people who have not a shilling in the world . " The police called you in , and the police can pay " is their attitude , and so it is with confinements . It is a matter of common knowledge that since the passing of the Act com- pelling midwives to call in skilled assistance in event of complications the doctors ' " engagement list " in many cases has been reduced to vanishing point . His emergency calls have increased in alarming proportions . Patients whom he has attended for several previous confinements and whose families he still attends , tell him in the most matter - of - fact way that they intend to " try the nurses this time as it is cheaper , and , of course , they have to send if anything goes wrong . The injustice to the doctor , who , in common with his pro- fessional brethren , fixed the average 21s . fee when he took easy and difficult cases alike and let one stand against the other , but who now is only called in where there are circum- stances likely to cause him considerable anxiety , and which may necessitate his obtaining at his own expense the services of a brother practitioner as assistant , chloroformist , etc. , does not appear to appeal much to some of our so - called social reformers . As one who has seen much of work amongst working women , let me say : For the sake of the race let none be left unattended . Insist on women having attention , but insist on in fact , and talk of the degradation of pauperizing them in name . Do not talk about " emergencies " in such a connec- tion . If a man cannot lay aside 7d . per week he has cer- tainly no right to produce children for starvation . If they are produced they should be the care of the State , and if the parents do not relish the sound of " Poor Law , " the remedy is in their own hands . For those who can afford to pay , let them be haunted by the relieving officer . The more unpleasant things are made for cadgers the better . - Yours , M. D. [ Unfortunately it is too often the unhappy wife who , after an exceptionally trying ordeal , is " haunted , " before she has had time to recover , by a male relieving officer . We submit that it is not the wife , who surely has done her share , but the husband , who should be " haunted . " ED . C.C. " ] To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , When there are so many grave grievances con- nected with women , it seems to me a pity to air such a trifling one as that of Mrs. Webb's . The same lady will tell you that " poverty is not a crime , " yet she is distressed when a woman has to admit she is poor and requires help from the Board of Guardians . It seems to me that the grievance is put right by being able to get that help . Supposing the help came directly from the State , it still would have to be paid for out of the ratepayers ' pockets . I can see no shame or degradation in taking help from the Board of Guardians when necessary . Yours , EMILY A. COOKE . Burnmoor , Sutton , April 24 , 1910 . THE COLOURS .

" Madam , It may interest some of your readers to note , if they have not already done so , the imagery which in " Songs Before Sunrise Swinburne gathers about the red , white , and green - the colours of Italy , which we seem to have appropriated to our own use , to be a standard of liberty in our eyes as they were in his . I have found such play of fancy in " The Halt Before Rome , " " Hertha , " " On the Downs , the " Epilogue , " and , in particular , the " Song of the Stand- ard .

MAY 5 , 1910 . THE COMMON WOMEN'S AMBITIONS . " that To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , If , as I quite believe , Agda Adelgren is in sincere sympathy with the women's cause , I heartily endorse the hope of a previous correspondent on this subject , that she will join one of the societies working for this object , and then I am convinced she will receive such enlightenment as will enable her to take a much broader view of the whole question . To begin with the first point in her last letter - viz . , the educated , broad - minded , level - headed , clever women of the nation should receive recognition and full rights of citizen- ship . " ete . This would be asking for a special form of fran- chise for women , whilst all Suffrage Societies are agreed that the standard of citizenship should be the same for both sexes , it being now recognised by all just - minded people that -to quote Mrs. Pethick Lawrence " no human being is good enough to be entrusted with absolute power over another human being , and no section or class of a community is good enough to be trusted with absolute power over another section or class . " The point I wished to emphasise was : Why should only " the educated , broad - minded , level - headed , etc. , etc. , women " be entitled to the franchise , whilst the humble , plodding , hard - working or sweated women should be debarred from the same privilege , when such conditions had not been asked or required of men ? masses . Agda Adelgren goes on to say : " But I am intensely keen on seeing only enlightened and strong - minded women leaders of women . ' This I consider has ever been , and will ever be . As John Stuart Mill points out , " It has always been the thinking few in each generation that has led the unthinking We do not expect to find the blind leading the blind . Besides , even amongst working women , I think it will be possible to find broad - minded , level - headed , clever women quite capable of using the vote creditably ; the vote in itself will not make any woman a leader of women , but it will enable women of all classes who have the necessary qualifica- tion to have a voice as to who shall represent them in the making of the laws which they are bound to obey . Yours , Lowther Street , Carlisle . MARY SLEE . [ This correspondence must now cease . - ED . " C.C. " ] QUEEN VICTORIA AND WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , Can you or any of your readers tell me in which of Queen Victoria's letters can be found the remarks that the Anti - Suffragists are so fond of quoting ? It would be interesting to read it with its context . - Yours , E. W. C A PROTEST FROM THE VOTELESS . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , In connection with the suggestion of Dora Edgell in last week's Common Cause , " " A Protest from the Vote- less , " it may be of interest to your readers to know that our society had an " unrepresented house " poster printed for the last election . It was printed in National Union colours and attracted a good deal of attention . It was well displayed on a house in the principal street of the village , which had not been unrepresented previously for more than forty years , and this fact made the poster the more striking , Yours , SARAH BANCROFT CLARK . Street , Somerset . [ It is an excellent idea . We hope the National Union will take it up . ED . " C.C. " ] A FINE OPPORTUNITY IN SOUTH SALFORD . Under this title , in an interesting letter which is , however , too long for publication , Mr. Robert Cooper , of Nelson , who did excellent work in South Salford at the last general election , points out that to defeat Mr. Belloc at the poll will be the best vindication of our honour possible . Mr. Cooper points out the good work already done in Salford , and the large measure of support the women already have there . Mr. Belloc , he says , has the reputation of being a mere talker , and a candidate who had the interests of the poor and the unemployed at heart would be persona grata to the electors , who are mostly very poor .

( Held over last week . ) NORTH OF ENGLAND ECCLES DIVISION . A Suffrage campaign was organised in the Eccles Division last week , April 18th to 23rd , and some very good propaganda work was done . Iwo public meetings were held , one in the Urmston Public Hall on the 19th , at which Miss Courtney and Miss Robertson spoke , and another at the Eccles Town Hall on the 20th , at which Councillor

CAUSE . 59 Margaret Ashton and Miss Robertson spoke , and had a very enthu- siastic reception . Miss Robertson addressed the Liberal women at Moorside on Thursday afternoon , and we had quite a lively debate at the meeting of the Roe Green Young Liberals on Friday evening , 22nd . A meeting was called on Saturday afternoon in the Burgon's Hall , Monton , and as the result of the week's campaign we were successful in forming the nucleus of what we hope will be a flourishing Suffrage Society in the Eccles Division . Miss Thirza Potts was elected chairman , and Mrs. R. A. Norbury hon . secretary . It is largely owing to the energy and enterprise of Mrs. Norbury that the work was so well done . NORTH OF ENGLAND - HYDE . An At Home was held in the P.S.A. Hall on Tuesday , April 19th . Mis B. Foxley made the evening a huge success , and replied in a most tactful and satisfactory way to the questions of the President of an Anti - Suffrage Society . There was a short and very interesting discussion . Four new members were enrolled , and several visitors who heard a Suffrage speech for the first time expressed a wish to know more about our movement . We intend they shall . Not the least enjoyable part of the evening was the programme provided by Misses H. Craven and J. Shanks ( pianists ) . Miss Lucy Cocks ( soprano ) , Mr. Shanks ( baritone ) , and Mr. Short ( elocutionist ) . NORTH OF ENGLAND - MARPLE . A most successful and crowded meeting was held on Monday , April 18th , in the Girls ' Institute to hear Mrs. Philip Snowden . Mr. L. W. Zimmerman took the chair . He said the public could not be asked much longer to believe that a woman is not entitled to the Parliamentary vote because she could not become a soldier . Even that quibble might possess some logical respectability but for the fact that of the million women exercising the municipal franchise he was not aware that one of them had been asked to become a police- man . Mrs. Snowden , who received an enthusiastic reception , said that enough had been said during the last few years on Women's Suffrage to convert everybody on the face of the earth , and still women were told they must not touch politics because they were dirty . The elderly sentimental Anti - Suffrage gentleman who likes to fancy all his women folk on pedestals she said made her most tired of all . Imagine all the women who work in factories on their pedestals ! All the sweated women " queens of the home " ! All the 60,000 women on the London streets all on their pedestals for that elderly gentleman ! The very interesting and spirited address was listened to with the keenest attention . The resolution was put and carried unanimously , our great regret being that some of the Anti - Suffrage people who were present did not ask questions or raise any discussion such as Mr. Zimmerman particularly asked for . Fourteen new member's joined the Society , and a good collection was taken . NOTTINGHAM . A very well - attended meeting was held in the Assembly Hall , Southwell , on Thursday night , Mrs. W. H. Blandy , of Nottingham , in the chair . The resolution was proposed by Mrs. Hoskyns , wife of the Bishop of Southwell , who said she had been in sympathy with the movement for many years , and would be glad to help to start a branch in Southwell . A short address was given by Mrs. W. E. Dowson , and a branch society was formed , with Miss Smith , of Vicar's Court , Southwell , as hon . secretary , and Mrs. Hoskyns , the Hon . Mrs. Handford , and other ladies on the committee , and mem- bens were enrolled forthwith . A vote of thanks was proposed by Dr. Handford , and a collection taken to defray the expenses . " Common Causes " and badges were sold . RAMSGATE . The above Society held a successful cake sale in aid of local funds at 8 , Royal Crescent , on Wednesday , April 20th . All members were invited to send a cake and come and buy a cake , and to bring friends with them to the sale . By this means a good sum was raised to help current expenses . The Society are not at present holding any big meeting , but hope to have a large garden meeting in the summer months . The visit of Mrs. Pankhurst to Ramsgate has done a great deal to arouse interest in the cause . REDHILL AND REIGATE . On the 20th a successful At Home was held in the Public Hall , Reigate . Mrs. Auerbach being in the chair . Sir John Cockburn , K.C.M.G. , spoke in favour of Women's Suffrage , and adduced his Australian experience as proving it to be beneficial to the Empire . The movement was bound to succeed very soon , he held . The social evening was preceded by a business meeting , at which the annual report was passed , and a presentation made to Miss R. I. Pym , the late hon . secretary of the Society , in grateful recognition of her devoted services to the Society . Mrs. Auerbach , the president , on behalf of the Society presented her with a travelling cloak . SALISBURY . " At the kind invitation of Mrs. Rudston - Read a drawing - room meet- ing was held at " Rotherwood on Monday afternoon , April 11th . Miss Abadam spoke on the Economic , Social , and Ethical Aspects of Women's Suffrage . An evening meeting was held on the same day at the Assembly Rooms with Miss Street of Wilton , in the chair . Miss Abadam spoke on The Magnetic Vole " and Mr. Joseph Clayton on Why Men Support Women's Suffrage . " Both meetings were well attended and very successful . We have to record our gratitude to the local press for long and sympathetic reports of the speeches and meeting . SCARBOROUGH . On the 20th a well - attended and successful conversazione was held at the Grand Hotel . At 8 o'clock the Suffrage comedy , " How the Vote was Won , " was presented by a company of ladies and gentle- men from Filey , under Miss Hankes , hon . secretary W.S.S .. and Mrs. Brown .

00 60 COMMON THE emphatically he believes in the cause of Women's Suffrage , introduced Mrs. Swanwick to the audience . She charmed all who heard her by her words , uttered in a beautifully clear , quiet , convincing voice . She unfolded the policy of the National Union for the next general election , explaining that Suffrage candidates will be run in suitable constituencies . She urged that this was to be regarded as a national work , and the candidates put forward , wherever it might be , should be regarded as national candidates , and in that sense she asked sup- port for the funds of the movement . Votes of thanks were tendered in able and telling little speeches by Mrs. Aldersen - Smith , Mr. Booty , and our very good friend and supporter , Dr. Handcock . Several new members joined , and many more are " thinking about it . " BIRMINGHAM . On Tuesday , April 26th , Miss Bertha Mason gave her lantern lecture on " The History of the Women's Suffrage Movement " to a large audience in the small theatre of the Midland Institute . Her clear and stirring account of the pioneers and her beautiful slides were much appreciated by all . Many realized for the first time how great a past our movement has , while the pictures of present - day work , the processions , caravans , etc. , showed them what splendid work the Union was doing all over the country . On Friday , the 29th , the West Bromwich Society was launched on its career as an independent organization under the most excellent auspices . With Mrs. Langley - Browne as secretary , and Mrs. J. Izon Chesshire as treasurer , and a strong committee , it cannot fail to have a successful life . The meetings in the Bull Ring will not be continued during May owing to pressure of other work . At the annual meeting on May 26th there will be a discussion on the formation of a Workers ' Club , to bring the active members of the Society together . Suggestions and resolutions for this and for other matters relating to the Society should reach the Secretary not later than May 19th . The office will be closed for a week at Whitsuntide . BOURNEMOUTH . A very pleasant afternoon was spent at the Assembly Rooms , Town Hall Avenue , on April 26th , forty - five members and friends being present . After tea Mrs. Earp , of Sheffield , gave some of her electioneering experiences and a capital address on lines which were new to most of us . This was followed by a recitation by one of our very active members , Miss Fonblanque . Two new members joined our ranks , and a collection was taken , which covered all expenses . Three reading clubs are being formed by Miss Morgan , The Englishwoman " being the periodical chosen . We feel very grateful to Mrs. Earp , who made herself known to us and gave us one afternoon out of her holiday in Bournemouth . We hope members from other branches will follow her example . DUNDEE . 33 On 27th April the " house - warming " of our new permanent office , 12 , Meadowside , took place successfully . We have secured very pleasant quarters in a central situation , and , being on the ground floor , we have the valuable asset of a window in which posters , notices , and literature can be shown . Our rooms looked charming on the night of the opening " At Home , " the green walls and white frieze setting off masses of red and white flowers , the posters , portraits of our leaders , and Botticelli's " Fortezza ( to which " The Common Cause " likens our Union ) . About sixty members and friends mustered , which we thought no bad beginning . Early in the evening amusement was caused by a sixpenny dip , " the articles left over from the fancy stall in the election shop being concealed in a huge barrel decked with our colours , and fished for , with the result that nearly £ 2 was cleared . Badges , " Common Causes , " and ties were also sold . 56 It was a great pleasure to welcome as chief speaker Dr. Elsie Inglis , from Edinburgh , and to her it is a satisfaction to see the vigour of the Suffragists on the banks of the Tay , Perth having so soon followed the lead of Dundee in forming a Society , and Tayport hoping soon to launch a branch . Before introducing the speakers , Dr. Emily Thomson , president of the Society , who presided , said she had a pleasant little duty to perform , and that was to present to Miss Alice Crompton , organizing secretary , a small token of the Society's recognition of her energetic and successful work at the time of the last General Election . Dr. Emily Thomson then handed to Miss Crompton a beautiful buckle , designed by a Suffragist artist and carried out in the National Union colours . Miss Crompton acknowledged the gift in a few feeling words . Miss Henderson , the delegate from the Society at the Annual Council Meeting of the N.U.W.S.S. , in a short speech emphasized the importance of the step which had been taken by the Council as regards the federating of the Societies , and urged that in this newly constituted triple alliance of Union , Federation , and Society there should be warm , mutual co - operation with an intelligent recog- nition of the true proportions of the administrative bodies and their respective claims . Dr. Elsie Inglis , in her eloquent and able appeal on behalf of the Scottish Federation , explained to the Society the proposed working of the Federation and the advantages that would accrue to the Societies by affiliating themselves to it - the £ 15 required from each Society being returned to them in value cent . per cent . During the course of the evening several new members joined . A rota of members has been formed to keep the office open from 11 to 1 and 2 to 5 daily , and from 7.30 to 9.30 on Wednesday evenings , the early closing day . Afternoon teas are provided daily in the office from 2 to 5 , at sixpence a head , and , as friends are willing enough to make gifts of tea , cakes , and so on , it is hoped this may be a fruitful little source of income . GALASHIELS . We are looking forward with great interest to the meeting to be held here on May 13th . Dr. Elsie Inglis and Miss Chrystal Macmillan are to speak . The Scottish Federation has sent down their organizer , Miss Florence Hilliard , at our request , and we hope with her help to make our meeting a great success , and to give the speakers a hearty welcome .

CAUSE . GLASGOW . MAY 5 , 1910 . On the kind invitation of Miss Macnaught a drawing - room meeting was held on the 28th at Casita , Burnside . Miss Macnaught wel- comed the guests and introduced Miss Helen Waddel and Mrs. Jas . T. Hunter , who addressed a most interested audience , Miss Waddel speaking on the general disqualifications of women , while Mrs. Hunter dealt specially with the social evil . Several questions were asked , and interesting points raised . At the close thirteen new members were enrolled - fully half of those present . We are glad to report that forty new members joined at the close of the meeting addressed by Lady Frances Balfour in Paisley on the 22nd . Miss Macnaught's is the fourth drawing - room meeting we have had within ten days , and although we do not yet know the exact number of new adherents gained through them , as several promised to join but have not yet done so , we have to record an addition of 114 up to date . LEEDS . Miss Thornton wishes to thank all those who contributed to make the sale of work so great a success . By the kind contribution of friends outside Yorkshire , Miss Foster ( the sale of work secretary ) was able to present the excellent balance of £ 67 19s . 3 d . LIVERPOOL . A very successful campaign has just ended at Widnes , where we have been endeavouring to form a new Society . On Monday , April 25th , we opened a committee - room that attracted much attention and interest . Each evening we held open - air meetings at alternate pitches , which were attended by large crowds ; the omnibus service had to be increased one evening in order to accommodate the passengers . We were fortunate in securing the services of Miss Chubb , Mrs. Beattie , the Rev. Mr. Roberts , the Rev. Mr. Parkinson , Mr. Allerton , and Mr. Frimstone , all of whom appealed to the people . The only drawback was the children , one man remarking that they were a shame to the mothers of Widnes . Before we left , however , they were our sworn friends , and said they would be good if only we would stay longer . Our house - to - house canvass was most satisfactory , and we instituted a new plan which perhaps other Societies may care to adopt . We had cards printed with the space for the names of five persons , and gave them to as many new members as possible , asking them to fill them up . By this means the membership is rapidly increased , and the members have something to do at once for the new Society . On Thursday we gave an At Home in the Committee - room , at which Mrs. Stewart - Brown and Mrs. Billings spoke . This resulted in Miss Morrison , of Farnworth , promising to be hon . secretary , and , judging from the friendly reception we received everywhere , I am sure a flourishing Society will soon be affiliated to the National Union . There are already fifty members , and a committee will no doubt soon be formed . LONDON . At the L.C.C. Schools , Victory Place , Walworth , a most successful meeting , organized by Miss Ingle , took place on Friday , April 29th , at 8.30 p.m. , Miss A. Helen Ward in the chair , with a view to inaugurating a branch of the London Society in the constituency . There were present influential men and women of all parties . The meeting was addressed by Miss H. D. Cockle , and also by Mr. Dawes , M.P. , the Liberal sitting member , and Mr. Belilios , the Conservative candidate , both of whom it is hoped will become vice- presidents of the branch , in addition to Canon Horsley , Mr. Kenwood , and Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Stead , the latter of whom kindly said a few words at the close of the evening . The resolution was carried with acclamation . Mr. Dawes referred at some length to the work of the Suffrage Conciliation Committee in the House , and spoke with the utmost hopefulness of a practical outcome of its efforts in the near future . Mr. Belilios declared that there was no possible logical objection to the reform . Miss Cockle pointed out that the time had now come when those who did not actively help forward the movement could not be regarded as friends , and Miss Ward made an urgent appeal to all present to become members . LONDON - BLACKHEATH . The last of a series of At Homes was held at Jobbin's Tea Rooms , Blackheath , on Thursday , April 21st . Mrs. Lovibond was in the chair , and a very interesting address was given by Miss Sheepshanks . The audience was small but very appreciative . Mrs. Adkin , the chairman of the branch , wrote resigning her position , as she is leaving the neighbourhood . The letter was received with much regret . Mrs Hay proposed and Mrs. Monk seconded a very hearty vote of thanks to Mrs. Adkin for her help and sympathy in the past , which was carried unanimously . A Cake and Candy Sale was announced for May 27th , par- ticulars of which will be issued very shortly . Contributions of cakes and sweets were invited for sale on that day . LONDON EALING AND ACTON . A very successful meeting was held here on the evening of April 29th in the Drill Hall . All the voters who had signed the petition at election time were asked to come . Mr. Kennedy , whose place seems instinctively to be on a Suffrage platform , took the chair , and very interesting speeches were delivered by Miss Ruth Young , Mr. Theo . Gugenheim ( of the Men's League ) , and Mr. Ben Johnson ( another local friend of Suffragists ) . The meeting was free , but no interruption of any kind occurred , and a substantial collection towards expenses , as well as the sympathetic hearing accorded to the speakers , is a cheering token that the advancement of our cause , if slow , is sure . LONDON HIGHGATE AND NORTH ST . PANCRAS . Since the General Election we have continued the open - air work , which we feel to be the right method of work for this thickly populated district . Our greatest encouragement comes from the fact of the large number of men who will stay out the whole meeting , generally two hours and often much longer , and at the end will ask quite intelligent and useful questions . Our plan is to keep to one pitch for each month ; in this way we are able to do some educative work . We always announce our next meeting , and impress upon our audience the fact that we are there primarily to answer questions and help solve their difficulties with regard to our

MAY 5 , 1910 . THE COMMON demand for enfranchisement . We ask them to think the matter over during the week and to come up on the following Saturday with their questions ready prepared . It is very cheering to note quite a respectable sprinkling of regular attendants . We have been so encouraged by our work that we have ventured to invest , through the kind contributions of our friends , in a speakers ' stand , which we find to be most useful , and also so comfortable that one shudders now to think of the old - time wobbling box . On Saturday last the speakers were Miss H. D. Cockle , Miss Ruth Young , Mrs. Rogers , and Mr. Simpson . We had a most enthusiastic crowd , and had difficulty in closing the meeting at the late hour of 10.45 p.m. , and , best of all , even then , left a crowd of men dis- cussing the matter between themselves . LONDON NORTH HACKNEY . Our public meeting in the Library Hall , Church Street , Stoke Newington , was most successful . Councillor White , B.A. , LL.D. , was in the chair , and read letters of apology for absence from Mr. Raymond Greene , M.P. for North Hackney , and also from the Mayors of Stoke Newington and Hackney . Miss Edith Palliser very clearly gave her reasons for wishing women to share in politics . She was followed by the Rev. Dr. Cobb ( Rector of St. Ethelburga's , Within Bishopsgate ) , who said there were two questions before them - the emancipation of women , and the women's cause , as such . What lay at the root of the present social trouble was economic distress , by which the best instincts of nature were being dammed up and refused proper expression , and which made the lives of women to - day one long - drawn - out sigh and tragedy . They had got to persuade the people of the country and get a majority on their side , convince them that their cause was right , and then it would not be long before it was carried to success . Miss Hodge spoke delightfully of the good effects of Women's Franchise in Australia ; and then Mr. Cholmeley ably answered some Anti - Suffrage questions , after which a vote of thanks to Dr. White concluded the meeting . LONDON - UXBRIDGE . The Uxbridge Branch was founded in April , 1909 , after being gathered together with great pains and toil by Mrs. Davidson , who is , unfortunately , not working for the Society now . owing to the necessity of complete rest after illness . An evening function , which included an entertainment and some speeches , was held to celebrate the first birthday . Miss Ruth Parrott and Miss Katherine Herbert ( both members of the Actresses ' Franchise League ) , and Mr. Rupert Harvey ( of the Men's League ) , gave a delightful selection of recita- tions , which were much appreciated by those present . Songs were contributed by Mr. Hutson and Mr. Parker . Miss G. Lees gave " Father William , " by Bensusan , and a piano solo was contributed by Mrs. Chellew . The speaker , Miss Estelle Ross , chose as her subject , " Lady McLaren's Charter and its Bearing on the Vote . " Badges and " The Common Cause " sold well , and everybody seemed to be pleased .

CAUSE . LOUDWATER ( BUCKS . ) . 61 On Tuesday , April 19th , Suffragists broke new ground just outside " The White Blackbird , " on London Road , Loudwater . The speaker was Mrs. Bonwick , and the chairman Mr. G. K. Knight . Part of High Wycombe and the three miles of road between the two places had been canvassed in the afternoon , and by seven o'clock most of the Loudwater children were in two rows on a fence , while the older portion of the community dissembled their interest by forming them- selves into casual groups not quite so near . Mrs. Bonwick's interest- ing talk , however , soon drew the audience together , and an attentive hearing was given . Riddles were asked afterwards , such as : " If women were in Parliament how long would it take them to pass the Budget ? " and " Is there more difference of opinion among women than there is among men ? " Somebody forgot to ask if the vote would cause dissension in the home ; but we had the " militant methods , " as per invoice , and " Tory gold , " to your esteemed order . The last delusion we did really succeed in dispelling . It seems that " Votes for Women " was the only topic of conversation in " The White Blackbird " the same evening . At least one elector has decided to " vote for it , " and word was sent that we are to have another meeting as soon as possible . Miss K. Raleigh , of Uxbridge , organized the trip . NORWICH . At the invitation of the Political Committee of the Gladstone Club , a meeting was held in their rooms on April 30th , to consider the question of Women's Suffrage . About seventy men and women were present . Dr. Mary Bell read a most interesting paper , beginning with a graphic sketch of the history of the movement from early times , and ending with an enlightening account of the wants and injustices suffered by the voteless women of to - day . Considerable amusement was caused when Dr. Mary Bell illustrated the inconsistency of the law by showing how , while it considered her incompetent to register a vote , it gave her the right to deprive any man of his vote , should she , with any other woman doctor , certify his insanity . A discussion followed till late into the evening . It was very disappointing to find the majority of the men , while admitting the justice of the women's cause , were yet unwilling to allow that the vote should be granted them , and basing their refusal on the ground of expediency , and what they considered to be party interest . NORWOOD . Our Society held its first public meeting in the Park Hall , Syden- ham , when Miss Abadam addressed a large and appreciative audience . So convincing were the arguments used that a man who came prepared with three questions refused to put them , remarking that the speaker handled her subject in such an able fashion that he was convinced his questions had better remain in his pocket . The members of the Norwood Society are highly gratified at the impression made by the first meeting held in Sydenham under the auspices of the N.U.W.S.S. OXFORD . On April 20th a public meeting was held at Woodstock in the Town Hall . The chair was taken by Mrs. Stables , and the speakers were Miss Abadam and A. Lindsay , M.A. Another public meeting was held at Witney , where seats were reserved for those electors who had signed our petition . Mrs. Hobbs took the chair . Miss Abadam and Mr. A. B. Gillet were the speakers . Both meetings were well attended and most successful . On Thursday , April 21st , a meeting for women only was held in the Assembly Rooms , Oxford . The chair was taken by Dr. Dorothy Maude , and Miss Abadam addressed the meeting on " The Vote as a Moral Lever . " The hall was crowded , and it must have struck every Suffragist present that it is impossible that the cruel wrongs under which women and girls suffer should continue much longer when we have women like Miss Abadam to rouse us to action . PERTH . A meeting of the above Society was held on April 22nd . Mrs. Scott Murray , our newly elected president , was in the chair . It was intimated that Miss Haldane had consented to be an hon . president , and Mrs. Saunders vice - president . Miss A. Compton , M.A. , was to have addressed the meeting , but owing to recent illness she was unable to do so . Miss Compton , however , sent a very efficient substitute in Miss Henderson . Miss Henderson , in considering our cause from the ethical point of view , drew our attention to one amusing fact : that the law makers were largely the law breakers , as the majority of criminals were men . In concluding Miss Henderson appealed to everyone loyally to support the National Union and our Scottish Federation . We regret having to lose Miss Greig , who has done so much to help our Society ; but realize that , wherever she is , she will do her utmost to help on the cause . SUSSEX , SURREY AND HANTS - BASINGSTOKE . A series of meetings has been held by Miss Gordon , B.A. , and Miss Edwards , of Fleet , the first being a capital debate between these ladies . Miss Edwards even succeeded in making the Chairman think she was a genuine Anti - Suffragist , which was really a feat . At Sherborne village the gathering was small but greatly interested in Miss Gordon's striking facts about sweated industries and unequal wages . At Hook , Miss Dorothy Edwards gave an excellent address , to which the audience listened with marked interest . After a short speech from Miss Gordon , showing the extent of the movement , the resolution was passed with applause . Mrs. Thomas Burberry kindly presided , and proved a most sympathetic chairman . WAKEFIELD . We held a members ' meeting on April 28th , and elected Mrs. J. Livesey Lee as president and Miss Beaumont as secretary . The treasurer is not yet appointed . A general committee has been chosen , with an executive committee of nine members . Mrs. Atcherly has kindly invited the members of the Society to her house , Haddon Leys , on May 23rd , to hear a paper by Mrs. Davies , of Horbury , on the history of the Women's Suffrage movement . We are very grateful to Mrs. Atcherly for her kind help , and trust that there will be a very good attendance of members .

62 WARWICK AND LEAMINGTON . THE COMMON The monthly meeting of this Society was held on Monday , April 25th , at 20 , High Stret , Warwick , by kind invitation of Mrs. Lloyd Evans . The chair was taken by Mrs. Brassington , secretary of the the Stratford - on - Avon branch . Miss Clanche Leppington was speaker . She received a warm welcome , and her earnest and sym- pathetic address was listened to with great appreciation . She dealt with the ideals of womanhood , treating the subject throughout with a wide outlook and from a very high standpoint . WINCHESTER . By invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Donald Nicoll , a well - attended drawing - room meeting was held at Burntwood , Martyr Worthy , on Thursday afternoon , under the auspices of this Society . The special speaker was Dr. Helen Boyle , of Brighton , and the chair was occupied by Mr. H. C. Pilcher , of Twyford . Other Societies . CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST WOMEN'S FRANCHISE ASSOCIATION . The Kensington Committee held a largely attended and most successful meeting for men and women engaged in business on Thursday , April 28th , at the Horbury Rooms . Lady Craggs was in the chair , and the speakers included Miss Ruth Young and Mr. Cameron Grant , who urged the great need of the Suffrage from the economic point of view . The meeting was admirably organized by Miss Rose Graham . IRISH BRANCH . A very successful drawing - room meeting was held in Dublin on Tuesday , April 26th , at 15 , Fitzwilliam Square , the residence of Mrs. Mackay Wilson . Mrs. Jonathan Hogg took the chair , in the unavoidable absence of Lady Arnott , president of the association . The claims of women to the Suffrage were ably advocated by Miss White , LL.D. , and Miss F. Meade . The speeches made a deep impression on the audience , and several new members were enrolled . YOUNGER SUFFRAGISTS . Thanks in the Our Hat and Flower Sale was a great success . first instance to the generosity of Lady Lawrence in lending us her delightful house . Our members were lavish in sending lovely flowers with which the dining - room was entirely smothered . The flowers sold rapidly to the crowd of friends who filled the room from 2 to 7 , keeping the sellers busy . In the drawing - room the atmosphere was distinctly different ; country atmosphere and scents had vanished before an array of smart town hats , which would have cured any Anti - Suffragist of the suspicion that we lose our taste for clothes in our new appreciation of politics . Miss Iris Clark was in charge of the hat department , and proved a genius at the work , while several younger Suffragists , acting as mannequins , might have stepped from were left , and after an the ateliers of Paris . Very few hats ineffective attempt to sell them to one another we closed the show , with a profit large enough to encourage another try . Tea was also provided , and paid well . Lady Lawrence was an indefatigable hostess , and one and all of the Younger Suffragists owe her hearty thanks . THE SUFFRAGE ATELIER . On Wednesday , May 11th , at 2.30 , Mrs. Kineton Parkes will address All friends are the Suffrage Atelier on " Shall We Pay Taxes ? " invited to attend at 1 , Pembroke Cottages , Edwardes Square , W.

Savile was in the chair , and the principal speaker was Mrs. Cecil Chapman , president of the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage , who advocated and explained the anti - Government policy to an audience which proved wholly sympathetic . A resolution to affiliate with the New Constitutional was carried unanimously . The Propaganda League will retain its present title and continue to circulate the literature of all Societies for which there is a demand , and to welcome Suffragists of every shade of opinion . The hon . secretary is Mrs. Darent Harrison . THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL SOCIETY FOR WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE . Mrs. Rhewon Guest very kindly acted as hostess for the Society and gave an At Home at 14 , Bedford Square , on Friday , April 22nd . Mrs. Guest herself took the chair and introduced Dr. Cobb to the audience in a charming speech . Dr. Cobb , who spoke earnestly and convincingly , seemed to wish to impress on the Women Suffragists present that it would be well if they could sometimes consult their men supporters as to methods , since the latter were able to judge the effect such methods had on other men , and the vote must , after all , be granted by men . Miss Decima Moore recited Mr. Housman's " Woman This and Woman That , " to the great delight of the audience . Mrs. Cecil Chapman then made a short speech about the financial position of the Society , and made an appeal for money for a paid worker . She announced that the Society had decided to join the W.S.P.U. procession on May 28th , and begged members to do their utmost to be present . A speech from Mr. Cecil Chapman brought the evening to a close , A beginning was made on Tuesday , April 19th , with the afternoon and evening At Homes in the shop , 8 , Park Mansions Arcade , Knightsbridge .

Mr. Baillie - Weaver held his audience enthralled while he demolished the case of the Anti- Suffragists in a witty speech , and Miss Hessel gave some really valuable statistics , which must inevitably help her Suffragist listeners in their work of conversion . Several new members were made .
