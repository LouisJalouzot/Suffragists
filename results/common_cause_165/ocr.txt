Rumoured Retirement of the Prime Minister . 610 Certain enemies of Women's Suffrage have assiduously circu- lated a rumour that the passing of any amendment to the Reform Bill emancipating women would be followed by the retirement of Mr. Asquith from the leadership of the Liberal Party . We are enabled to state upon unimpeachable authority that this rumour is without foundation , and that Mr. Asquith is not contemplating the breach of faith that would be implied by the intention unjustly attributed to him . To have promised a fair field to the amendments while secretly hampering them by causing it to be known that he would retire if they succeeded , would have been a piece of treachery not only discreditable to any Minister capable of it , but damaging to the character of English political life . We rejoice , not merely for the sake of Women's Suffrage , that the rumour may be definitely branded as false . The Word " Male . " 61 An excellent letter from Mrs. Swanwick , dealing with the proposed amendment to delete the word male from the Reform Bill appeared in the Manchester Guardian for Novem- ber 29th . Among the many rumours ( some of which rather deserve the name of conspiracies ) now being actively circulated is that which says that if the amendment to delete the word male 32 can be defeated , the Government will be able to drop the Reform Bill without breaking the Prime Minister's pledge to the Suffragists , since all their further amendments will be defeated before they are introduced . But , as Mrs. Swanwick pertinently asks , how can the " male " amendment be defeated except by the voting against it of Suffragist members of the coalition , and by what reason for that breach of faith could any such member be actuated unless by a fear that the passage of the amendment would lead to a break - up of the Government . At this point comes in the suggestion that Mr. Asquith would resign if women were enfranchised - a report which the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies knows to be entirely without foundation . No Complications . In the words of Mrs. Swanwick on the amendment to delete the word " male , " no complications will exist . It is a vote on the bare principle that , whatever qualifications are subsequently laid down , sex shall not in itself be a disqualification ; it is also

If any suffragist members of the coalition vote against it , the public will know what to think of the value they set upon the word of honour of their leader . It is they who in effect are making the grossest attack upon the good faith of Mr. Asquith . Pillar - Box Outrages . The latest shape assumed by " militancy " combines the greatest possible amount of public irritation and inconvenience with the least possible likelihood of persuasion . The breaking of windows , although illogical and reprehensible , has at least precedents and is associated in the general mind with elections and other political disturbances . But to damage or destroy at haphazard the letters of persons quite unknown is a procedure which has no conceivable connection with the securing of Par- liamentary enfranchisement for women . It is an act deliberately anti - social , an infringement of all those rules which must be observed for mutual convenience in any civilised community , and at the same time it is an infringement of so petty and spiteful - seeming a character as to arouse a mingling of indigna- tion and contempt . It is a bitter thing for law - abiding suffra- gists to see these displays of childish malignity associated with the name of a cause of which they have always done their utmost to uphold the dignity and the honour . Lead Poisoning and Potters . A Departmental Committee to inquire into lead poisoning and other dangers of the pottery trade was appointed in 1908 and sat at intervals for two years . It presented a report containing various recommendations ; certain manufacturers protested to the Home Office against some of these ; and certain operatives protested against others . Finally , the Home Office arranged that there should be an inquiry at Stoke - upon - Trent . At this inquiry the manufacturers appear to have shown a conciliatory spirit . Only on one point was there a difficulty with them , and a middle way has been found which satisfies both the masters and the Home Office . A question as to the heat of the ovens and one . as to the permissible provision of milk or cocoa for women and young persons alone remains over for adjustment . It may at last even of almost complete extinction of the horrible suffering's be said that we are in sight of a great diminution - possibly inflicted by lead poisoning . But while lead is used at all the danger will in some degree remain , and since leadless glaze- ware of almost every quality and of the most various prices may now be bought by the private purchaser , we would strongly urge all women when buying crockery to inquire into this point and to choose articles which cannot possibly inflict disease and death upon those who fashion them . Fatigue and Efficiency . 1-0 At the last week's meeting of the Sociological Society , Miss B. L. Hutchins gave an address on " Fatigue and Efficiency , a subject which has been claiming some attention of late from certain organisers of industry , but which has lacked the basis of sufficient scientific investigation . Indeed , as Miss Hutchins pointed out , Miss Goldmark's book ( the title of which served as the text of her address ) was the first systematic attempt to present the results of the study of fatigue as a base for labour

4 DECEMBER 6 , 1912 . THE legislation . The kernel of this address was a demonstration of the uneconomic nature of the fatigue of the worker , a fact which Miss Hutchins exemplified by reference to the deductions of modern psychology and to practical experiments carried out at Salford , at the Engis Chemical Works , near Li√®ge , and else- where . She showed how the dictum of experience was that the productiveness of machinery depended largely on the skill of the operator and how that very skill was impaired by over - fatigue . Thus , production and profit in the factory were seriously dimin- ished during the last hours of the day when the worker's physical power was at its nadir . * * * Moreover , in certain factories where hours had been reduced , no loss had ensued , but rather an increased output and efficiency . It follows that the drive and overwork of production in the nineteenth century was even unprofitable and that the duty of the present generation is to overhaul an antiquated " system " of work and to readjust the hours of labour whereby industrial overstrain - so wasteful to worker and work - shall at length be abolished . As the burden of such fatigue lies heavily at present on numbers of the potential mothers of the nation , it is a matter of importance to all women to know that the exhaustion due to overwork in factory and workshop is not only inhuman , but economically unsound . Mr. Lansbury . The observations of newspapers and of politicians upon the defeat of Mr. Lansbury furnish ample food for ironic meditation . The COMMON CAUSE prefers , instead of adding another item , to adopt the admirable tribute printed by Mr. Philip Snowden in last Wednesday's Christian Commonwealth : - Mr. Lansbury's loss from Parliament is to be deplored most of all because of his individuality and independence , because of the very attributes which have led to his withdrawal . There should be room in the British House of Commons for a man of his earnest- ness , large - heartedness , and fearlessness . Though he might be an annoyance and irritation to Governments and to politicians prone to take things easily , such men as he are as the salt of the earth , and much can be forgiven in the matter of differences of opinion on matters of policy , when what some may consider to be mistakes are due to an overwhelming passion to help the weak and suffer- ing and to extend the bounds of human freedom . The defeat of George Lansbury is an irreparable loss . Married Women and Income Tax . The dishonest attitude of the English law towards the married woman as income - tax payer is generally of advantage to the public treasury as against the individual purse ; but now and again the weapon turns against authority and some woman scores . " Dr. Alice Burn , who has been living for seven years in England while her husband has remained in New Zealand , claimed exemption on the ground that she was a married woman living with her husband , and a demand for ¬£ 30 made upon her was withdrawn . The point upon which the decision turned seems , as far as can be judged from rather conflicting Press reports , to be that the husband was regularly sending money to his wife . The result would appear to be that Dr. Burn's own income goes untaxed because the English law treats it as her husband's , and a man in New Zealand pays his income tax , if any , there . " 3 The London County Council and Women's Suffrage . At the meeting of the London County Council on November , 26th the report of the Parliamentary Committee was considered . It comprised various recommended additions and alterations to the Government's proposed Reform Bill , and Mr. Lithgow moved the addition , and Mr. Cotton seconded an amendment that " Women ( including married women ) should be entitled to exercise the franchise at local government elections on the same conditions as men . The amendment was carried by 54 votes to 48 , Lady St. Helier , we regret to see , voting in the minority . This recommendation , if adopted , would remove that invidious differentiation against women lodgers which is defended by the insulting declaration that it is intended for the exclusion of women of bad character . As a matter of fact , women living in rooms ( who are " lodgers " ) are at least as respectable as women living in flats ( who are " occupiers " ) , and , either way , why should the franchise laws attempt to discriminate against women of bad character when no attempt is made to deny votes to men of bad character ?

The following statement issued by the Press Department of the National Union of Suffrage Societies deserves to be read , re - read and pondered both by members of the societies and by all other people interested in public affairs : - Gossip in the Lobby has been lately making mischievous suggestion in two directions . It has discussed the possibility of the withdrawal of the Franchise Bill , and has attempted to promote the belief that the passing of a preliminary amend- ment to delete the word male " would rule subsequent Women's Suffrage amendments out of order . The time table as indicated by the Prime Minister gives no justification what- ever for the suggestion that he has any intention of contraven- ing the pledge given on November 17th , 1911 , to withdraw the Bill or to reverse either in the letter or in the spirit the pledges regarding the intention of the Government to proceed with the Bill ; and the introduction of amendments to enfran- chise women on other terms than men would weaken the pres- tige of the Liberal Party beyond recovery . It cannot be supposed for one moment that the Government should wish to see itself , in the words of the Westminster Gazette , " ' enmeshed ' in its own procedure . ' Nothing could have been more explicit than Mr. Lloyd George's utterances at the Albert Hall on Feb- ruary 23rd when he dealt with the Prime Minister's pledges to Mrs. Fawcett on November 17th . Mr. Lloyd George said : - " " I know Mr. Asquith , and I know that there is no man in England who has a more sensitive regard to his pledged word than he has , and when I hear suggestions that if the Government intro- duces a Reform Bill it will not be persevered with , I say that is an imputation of deep dishonour which I decline to discuss . No Government could commit such an outrage on public faith without forfeiting the respect of every honest man and woman in the land . You go through all these pledges , and you will find that Mr. Asquith repeated in every phrase and form those undertakings that the Bill will be introduced and carried through all its stages this session . " Not only do Mr. Asquith's words involve the promise of no action on the part of the Whips , but if the spirit of them is to be kept the creation of an atmosphere in any degree prejudicial to the amendments is equally precluded . The amendment to omit the word " male " must of necessity rally all those who are in favour of the principle of Women's Suffrage pure and simple . In 1911 the Irish showed a majority of 22 for the Conciliation Bill ; amongst Conservatives support is strong and reliable . Mr. Asquith has told us that a majority of the Cabinet are in favour of Women's Suffrage , the entire majority supporting it in the House is reckoned at 131 . Mr. Ramsay Macdonald's speech on the occasion of the intro- duction of Mr. Snowden's ' amendment to the Home Rule Bill on November 5th was a striking prelude to the action announced before on behalf of the Labour Party to " fight all the way and every ditch of the road respecting the enfranchisement of women , and to vote at every stage of the Government for the inclusion of women in its scope . " On the same night Mr. Anderson , chairman of the Independent Labour Party , was strategy of the Labour Party would be in the direction of assuring the vast audience at the Albert Hall that the whole securing the enfranchisement of women in the Reform Bill , and the appeal of the National Union for funds to carry out its campaign brought an immediate response of ¬£ 5,300 .

600 THE COMMON demand which Conservative Anti - Suffragists have made for a final mandate from the constituencies was disposed of vigor- ously by Mr. Lloyd George on December 16th , 1911 , at the Horticultural Hall . " The Prime Minister has declared on behalf of the Government that Women's Suffrage is an open question . Therefore the influence and the position of the Government will not be utilised to prevent a triumphant issue . Is it the House of Commons that will prevent it ? The decided majority of the House of Commons are pledged to it . I am told we have no mandate for carrying it in the Present Parliament . Why not ? How is the House of Com- mons to receive a mandate ? There is only one way , and that is that each member should get it from his own constituents . HI forget how many members of the House of Commons there are who are pledged to Women's Suffrage , but they are all pledged within sight of their constituencies . They were pledged at the last . election and previous elections . Most of them have voted for Bills , and since they have voted for them they have gone twice to their constituents and been returned . The Prime Minister in the year 1908 declared that it was an open question , and that if it were carried by a majority of the House of Commons and incorporated in a Government Bill , the Government would accept responsibility for it . From that moment it ceased to be a pious opinion . It became an issue of the first practical importance , and the con- stituencies when they returned men after that declaration , pledged to support an amendment in favour of the inclusion of women , must have known that they were voting for something with which they would be confronted for the first time as an Act of Parliament . Therefore there is nothing in the cry of no mandate . " The defeat of the Conciliation Bill was due to causes which were irrelevant to the question at issue , and since Mr. Lloyd George uttered these words , the elections of Crewe and Mid- lothian have strengthened the evidence of support in the constitu- ences by increasing the poll of that party which made Women's Suffrage an integral part of its policy , and it has visibly weakened the party whose members supported Women's Suffrage in prin- ciple , and voted against the Conciliation Bill . Sir Edward Grey made it clear that he would not have been a party to the introduction of any Bill which was not going to give the House of Commons a fair opportunity to put Women's Suffrage in . He said that it was to him inconceivable that the House of Commons , which had more than once by large majorities approved the principle of Women's Suffrage , should calmly proceed to pass through all its stages a Bill widening the Suffrage for men , without doing something to remove the barrier against women having votes . If that happened , the House of Commons would have stultified itself , and would have placed itself in an entirely indefensible position . Such action would indeed imply a wholesale repudiation of democratic principle , and failure to pass an amendment render- ing possible the enfranchisement of women , is indeed " incon- ceivable " except under conditions involving such deep dishonour that Mr. Lloyd George declined to discuss them . If the incon- ceivable happened , it could only bring down on the Cabinet the charge of a repetition of the subtle influences , which in the spirit are subversive of the free vote , for the Liberal Press has worn out the appeal to excuse on the score of militant tactics , and in view of both past and recent events , objections on that score cannot with impunity be urged either by the Nationalists or by the members of the Opposition . Amongst the militants them- selves , none but fanatics can fail to recognise the reprehensible folly of offering further refuge to their enemies , however much it inay have been courted by Anti - Suffragists in the House . The division on November 5th , and the fact that Liberals voted according to their principles and against the Government Whips , gives a reliable indication of the limits beyond which party influence is powerless , and the ruling of the Chairman at the recent Liberal Conference at Nottingham at least served the purpose of proving how strong was the hostile criticism which it occasioned amongst the delegates there present . It brought out incidentally , moreover , an exhibition of the temper of the Liberal women , a temper plainly indicated by a large section of them at their last council meeting on June 4th , 1912 , when one , at least , of their leaders declared that if the Reform Bill was passed without women being included she would work for the Labour Party . It cannot be denied that another reverse to the Suffrage Move- ment for which the Government and its followers were respon- sible , and in which the Labour Party were not involved , would bring the Liberals face to face with the question as to how far it would be possible by subsequent action ever to regain the confidence forfeited by breach of faith , either on the part of members of the Cabinet or of the House . On the other hand , an overwhelming majority for the deletion of the word " male " will be the first step in allaying those suspicions which have been accentuated by former action in the House of Commons . It lies with the party in power , therefore , to con- vince the Irish that it is not to the interest of the Government

CAUSE . DECEMBER 6 , 1912 . to lay itself open to attack on the score of desertion of principle , or to court the risk of bitter hostility from the Suffrage forces inside and outside Parliament , a risk which the proximity of a General Election would render truly formidable . Women . Employments for Trained Wo << It is now two years since the Women's Educational and Industrial Union of Boston ( U.S.A. ) issued an interesting report entitled Vocations for the Trained Woman . The first impres- sion given by a perusal of the volume is one of surprised admira- tion at the energy and adaptability of American women ; the second , a wonder whether perhaps in this country , too , there may not be women carrying on , unobserved , occupations as , responsible and as novel . In any case the economic conditions of America are similar enough to those of Great Britain to make the experiences of women in New York of value to women in London , Glasgow , or Manchester . Here as there it is true that , in the words of the preface to this book , many women who are unfitted for teaching drift into it because it is the vocation with which they are most familar , " and that many who make poor teachers might become able workers if wisely guided into other fields . Significant to English readers is the observation that the better known professions - law , medicine , architecture - have been omitted , to make room for vocations less known and less easily inquired into . Medicine , yes ; but law ? architecture ? Are these callings indeed so common for women in the States of New York and Massachusetts as to need no description to students who would enter them ? The arts and crafts are also omitted , as well as ordinary teaching ; but some forms of teach- ing " for which the demand is great and the supply inade- quate " are included . << The report marks its modernity by beginning not with domestic occupations , but with " Social and Economic Service . " In the Civil Service of the United States more than 13,000 women were employed , but only 17 of these at salaries of above ¬£ 360 per annum . * A colleeg trained woman employed in the Bureau of Labour wrote : " Women stand a particularly good chance in Government work , because the salaries are not sufficiently large to induce the best men to enter the service , but are better than the salaries received by women in other non - federal callings . You have , therefore , capable women and less capable men in many Government positions . " In the city of Greater New York police matrons seem to be invariably employed at police stations , and it is considered that the occupation offers an opening for women in middle life of high character and intelligence , and imbued with " a practical mis- sionary spirit . " Probably such women would find a field here , too . Probation officers are employed in many towns of America in connection not only with children , but also with adults , and in Greater New York there were , in 1910 , 27 paid women probation officers , a number that seems inadequate when we read that at the same date 50 to 150 women and girls were brought every night before the Night Court in New York City . A temporary home for prisoners released on probation and an employment bureau have been established . Records of the results would be profoundly interesting . Under the heading of " Domestic Science and Arts " are to be found the names of two callings unknown to English life , those of the " Institutional Dietitian " and the " Visiting Dietitian " -although the work of the latter is akin to that of the " pudding lady " familiar in some districts of London . The Institutional Dietitian is a woman trained in the science of food and in household economics , who superin- tends the dietary departments and food administration of some institution - hospital , school , settlement , etc. Hotels , boarding- houses , and clubs are reported as beginning to engage such women ; and there are many costly schools in England where the diet might become both more nutritious and cheaper if a person with a scientific knowledge of food values were in charge . In America , and to some extent in England , women find employ- ment as private caterers . " They arrange for luncheons , dinners or dances , planning , preparing , and providing for every detail , and imparting a certain individuality not always to be obtained at a hotel or restaurant . Akin to such work , and less precarious , is that of visiting housekeeper . One lady filled this post to three families at once , spending a couple of hours daily at each house , arranging meals , and seeing that no detail of domestic work was being neglected . She also ordered in " " . " * It must be remembered that the purchasing power of any given sum is lower in America than in England , although it is difficult to say precisely how much lower .

DECEMBER 6 , 1912 . THE COMMON provisions , etc. To English notions her rate of pay ( ro a month ) seems high ; on the other hand , skilled supervision of this kind undoubtedly saves money , and , of course , domestic help of all kinds is dear in America . A It is under the head of " Business " that some of the most interesting narratives and suggestions are to be found . manufacturer of paints relates how a young woman of seven - and- twenty whom he employed was given some advertising to do . " I explained to her the three classes of customers with whom she must deal , house painters , dealers and consumers , covering every social class from the lowest to the highest . It was her duty to interest these people in any way she might choose . " Having already studied chemistry , she proceeded to investi- gate the nature of the product , and then to read practical instruc- tions about paint . After having thus prepared herself , she wrote letters to the painters explaining the merits of the process , etc. , and from the various answers received judged what form of address was likely to be effective with different groups of cus- She had begun with a part - time salary of ¬£ 1 8s . a week ; in less than three years she was receiving ¬£ 4 and refused an increase , preferring less work to more pay . This gentleman believes that the employment of an intelligent , college - trained woman as advertisement manager would more than repay its cost in many manufacturing houses . tomers . " " CC In " Department Stores " American women seem to have been making their way into well - paid positions rather more rapidly than in England . Six stores were investigated , and women were found in three of the four main divisions of responsi- bility especially , however , as buyers . Very few were floor managers ( shop - walkers ) . One superintendent said he had tried women in this capacity , and was convinced that they were not equal to the position . In another store , but a few doors away , a woman was floor - manager in one of the busiest depart- ments , and the superintendent declared her as efficient as any man in the house . It is interesting to note that there are employers who declare women incapable of filling every post that they are filling with credit and success in the firms of others . In all these positions the entering salary - as saleswoman - is very low , and a well - educated woman has , at that point , no advantage over an ill - educated one . The hours also are long and the holi- days short . On the other hand , the salaries of the higher posts are larger than any woman except a successful doctor , writer , actress , or singer is likely to earn . One firm paid a minimum of ¬£ 1,000 a year and a maximum of ¬£ 10,000 to its head buyer . Trips to Paris form part of such a woman's duties . The investi- gators note that of 21 women interviewed who were occupying executive posts in stores , 4 " All were entirely self - supporting , and all but two were supporting at least one other . And yet employers , when charged with holding women down to lower wages than they give men for the same work , offer the excuse that the men have families to support , while the women have only themselves . " The account , under " Special Forms of Teaching , " of the Union's School of Salesmanship is suggestive . In addition to a good deal of theoretic and general instruction , discussions and demonstrations " are included in the course . Real customers come to buy real articles , while the class looks on and takes notes of strong and weak points . The sale over , the seller criti- cises herself , the class follows suit , and finally the customer explains why she bought or failed to buy . Space fails for touching upon many other points both interest- ing and instructive which occur in the course of this volume . It might advantageously be in the hands of parents , teachers , and municipal councillors , full as it is of suggestions and of guiding facts . The spirit in which it is written is admirable ; sobriety of statement is fused into warmth by an underlying conviction that every women who does well in a new line is enlarging the borders for all her sex ; and that to discover a new branch of honest and remunerative work is to be a good servant to the community . We should add that Messrs . Longmans are the publishers of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union . Another Woman Tax Resister . Mrs. Hervey , of Brackenhill House , Bromley , has successfully resisted the entrance of the tax collector since May . On Novem- ber 29th the necessary warrant to break into the premises was obtained , and the tax collector , the bailiff , and the policeman succeeded in filing the chain on the gate and breaking into the back door . Distraint was levied , goods were seized , and will be sold by public auction . SUPPORT OUR ADVERTISERS . All Readers are

CAUSE . Unfounded Rumours . 601 The Anti - Suffragists are very busy circulating rumours calcu- lated to divide and weaken the Women's Suffrage forces . The suggestions put forward are cleverly calculated to alienate sup- port from the varoius W.S. amendments to the Franchise Bill in turn , so that no one of them may obtain a majority . Further , persistent efforts are being made to foster all kinds of doubt and uneasiness in the minds of the Constitutional Suffragists in order to make them slacken their efforts to secure the passage cf a W.S. amendment to the Franchise Bill , for which an oppor- tunity will be given in January , and adopt the less practical policy of demanding a Government measure which there is not the least chance of obtaining . In our campaign to secure the inclusion of women in the Franchise Bill we shall , of course , have to meet many dangers and difficulties ; but the worst possible spirit in which to meet dangers and difficulties is a spirit of doubt in our power to over- come them , and of distrust in the good faith of our allies . We hope the following statement may help to remove some of the unfounded doubts which the Anti - Suffragists are seeking to foster : - 1. The rumour that Mr. Asquith will resign if any measure of W.S. is passed in this Parliament has been given a new lease of life lately . It has even found its way into the columns of the Labour Leader , hitherto a well - informed supporter of Women's Suffrage . We are able to state quite definitely , on excellent authority , that there is no truth whatever in this rumour . 2. The rumours about the Franchise Bill amendments may be summarised as follows :-( a ) That if the word " male " is deleted from Clause 1 , full Adult Suffrage will have been established , supposing the subsequent amendments are not carried ; ( b ) that if the deletion of the word " male is carried , the subsequent amendments will be out of order ; ( c ) that no Women's Suffrage amendments to the Franchise Bill will be in order owing to the defeat of the Conciliation Bill last March . CC In the opinion of Sir John Simon , who drafted the Bill , of Sir Edward Grey , who will move the amendment to delete the word male , " and of the Chairman of Committees , in whose hands the decision will rest , there is no ground for any of these suggestions . C. E. MARSHALL ( Hon . Parliamentary Sec . , pro tem . ) . Modern Needlecraft . Commenting on women's skill in needlecraft , as evidenced by the Christmas Sale of Work now being held by The Ladies ' Work Society , a writer in the Standard says that " a detailed inspection leads to the conviction that in regard to fancy work women have lost nothing of their skill since the days when Queen Matilda and her ladies worked the famous Bayeux tapestry . " We think , however , that women have added greatly to their skill and art in this direction since those days . Anyone familiar with the work of the Trade Schools for Girls in London , or with the output of the needlework classes of the L.C.C. Schools of Arts and Crafts , will claim superiority at least in draughtsmanship for the modern woman . Our one great need at present seems to be , not the spur of comparison with the feats of the needle of old - time Royal personages , but the multiplication of Schools of Arts and Crafts , and especially of Trade Schools for Girls throughout the country .

602 Some New THE COMMON Books . SEX AND SANCTITY . By Lucy Re - Bartlett . ( Longmans , 2s . 6d . net . ) In this collection of essays - of which the first and longest has provided the title for the volume - Mrs . Re - Bartlett offers a sequel to her previous contribution " on the relation as " 33 The of Woman to Man , but while the earlier volume , Coming Order , " was an exposition of certain laws of life , the present work deals with the principles behind those laws . The chief of these principles , according a co - ordi- to the author , is " integrity , " understood nation of all the parts of the individual self and as a relation between the self and society . The groping after " integrity is shown through the course of these essays to be the driving- force which underlies many of the modern upheavals . Hence , the stir of the Woman's Movement , the outbreak of " mili- tancy , " women's recourse to celibacy " are , from the author's point of view , merely manifestations of the breaking of the bonds of an old - time order in order to obtain more breathing- room for humanity . It may be that Mrs. Re - Bartlett sets forth in these essays much that is being propounded to - day from plat- form and press , but it is given to few to interpret present events with such sympathetic insight , or to express thought with so much lucidity and directness . The three concluding essays , which deal with the spiritual life of the individual are , however , open to the objection that the mysticism therein expressed will be apt to mislead and confuse the average reader . 33 * * * " THE UPHOLSTERED CAGE : THE CASE OF THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER . By Josephine Pitcairn Knowles . ( Hodder and Stoughton , 6s . ) This book is so amazingly ill - written that its appearance Miss Knowles pours forth a in print is something of a marvel . jerky , ungrammatical stream of words in which the same expres- sions are used again and again ; she has no vocabulary , no pre- cision , not even care enough to keep pronouns of the same number as their antecedent nouns .

The cruel case of the elderly woman who has spent her life not as an individual , but as a relative , and who is left on the death of a parent without either money or training , is pressed upon our attention ; and in a striking comparison Miss Knowles compels us to perceive that the poor lady who gives up her respectability is richer not only in money and enjoyment , but in opportunity of mental development than her virtuous sister ; and that , practi- cally speaking , the poor lady who works and is happy is excluded just as much from society " -which never invites her -as is the woman whose conduct has exiled her an arresting indictment of our social conditions . It is a thousand pities that so reasonable and interesting a book should be so much obscured by hasty and careless writing . * * * THE ENGLISHWOMAN , December , 1912. ( Sedgwick and Jackson , Is . net monthly . ) 99 The Englishwoman contains another of Mr. P. W. Wilson's sensible and sober yet outspoken articles about women's suffrage . The aim of this one is to point out a " middle way " between the policies of the extremist anti- suffragists and that of the irreconcilably militant suffragists . He makes it quite clear that the movement is now far too strong to be crushed by any Parliamentary rejection ; and that the defeat of the amendment to the Reform Bill could only lead to a conflict between the Liberal Party and the women's movement He remarks that , on a question of extending the franchise . " if the decision in January goes against the amendments , Liberalism will be faced by the most formidable flank attack in its recent history -a sentence which would be more absolutely true if " Liberalism " were replaced by the Liberal Party . The principles of Liberalism will survive the rout of all and any existing Liberal politicians , but the party may easily find itself out of office for years as a result of false policy in regard to the emancipation of women .

He has not realised that in most cases the objection is less to having a vote than to other women's having one . Among other excellent articles in the number are the following : - " The Campaign Work of Women in the United States , " " " Father Blakhal's Services to Madame de Gordon , " and " Women and the Average Englishman . " * * * THE STORY OF NEWNHAM COLLEGE . By I. B. J. Sollas . ( W. Heffer and Sons . 6d . net . ) 44 The advance of the Woman's Movement into the educational field has been so rapid that it seems necessary even at this period to remind the casual observer that a phase of struggle also pre- ceded the sharing by women of this form of the social heritage . The Story of Newnham College " well illustrates the point . The present four halls of residence for women at Cambridge date back to the beginnings in 1871 , when a private house for the accommodation of five students was taken with some hesitation on account of the financial risk . " At that time a desire for learning was thought to be , if not unwomanly in itself , at least a concomitant of unwomanliness , " and it needed all the strength and sweetness of character of the pioneers of the College to wear down this popular prejudice . Luckily , as the author of this little book points out , help in this struggle for higher education was not con- fined to women , for some of the men of the highest reputation in the University gave their interest and support . The excellent portraits of the founders of Newnham College included in this publication lend it special interest . " Books Received . THE UPHOLSTERED CAGE : THE CASE OF THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER .

604 THE COMMON Joint Campaign Committee . Meeting at the Opera House . The Joint Campaign Committee , which was responsible for the organisa- tion of the meeting held on Wednesday in the Opera House , was formed about a year ago to promote the passage of a Women Suffrage amendment The Committee exists " to secure the to the Franchise Reform Bill . Enfranchisement of Women on Broad and Democratic Lines , " and con- sists of a number of Members of Parliament and representatives of the following societies : -Fabian Society , Men's League for Women's Suffrage , National Industrial and Professional Women's Suffrage Society , National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , National Women's Labour League , People's Suffrage Federation , Scottish Women's Liberal Federation , Women's Co - operative Guild and the Women's Liberal Federation . The officers of the Committee are Mr. Arthur Henderson , M.P. , Chairman ; Mr. Walter Rea , M.P. , Hon . Secretary ; and the Lady Cowdray , Hon . Treasurer . The Committee employs two organisers , who have been working in different part of the country and have co - operated with other Societies in the organisation of meetings , but this is the first great meeting held in London under the auspices of the Committee . Its peculiar character lies in the fact that it was not a public meeting , but a National Meeting of Delegates from Societies whose object , or one of whose objects , is to Members of Parliament and secure the enfranchisement of women . delegates from many Societies filled the House , the National Union making a fine show in the Grand Circle . Mr. Henderson , M.P. , chairman at the morning session , declared that it was an honour to preside over this important and far - reaching con- ference . The Committee did not underate the difficulties created by the failure to carry the second reading of the Conciliation Bill , but they did not admit that a majority of 14 should wipe out all the previous decisions of the House of Commons in favour of Women's Suffrage . It was said that the House was not free , that the safety and convenience of the Government must be consulted and they couldn't risk resignation . He protested against these suggestions of dishonour . The standard of political morality was not very high , but he had yet to learn that there was none left . The head of the Government had pledged himself last November to a certain course of action . Their immediate business was with the House , and it was to the constituencies that they must and did look . They expected the Government to redeem its pledges in the letter and the spirit . He appealed to that meeting to show unity , determination and hopefulness . ( Cheers ) . SIR JOHN SIMON , K.C.V.O. , K.C. , M.P. , moved the following resolu- tion : - " That this National Meeting of Delegates calls on the House of Commons to include the enfranchisement of women on broad and democratic lines in the Franchise and Registration Bill , and that copies of this Resolution be sent to Members of the Cabinet and to the leaders of the other parties in the House of Commons . " He drew attention to the fact that the resolution appealed to the House as a whole , and it was addressed to every member of the House , whether a member of the Government or not , who is a suffragist . He alluded to the fact that there had been a majority in the House ever since 1886 , and if every member had only one opinion , Woman's Suffrage should have been passed any time during the past generation . He then dealt in detail with the situation , saying that the promises of the Prime Minister put Women's Suffrage in a position vastly superior to any in which it could have been put by any private member . He quoted the four questions asked by the National Union in November , 1911 , and answered by Mr. Asquith in the affirmative and pointed out that by bring- ing the question to an issue on the deletion of the word male " in the very first sentence of the Bill , a favourable issue was to be expected . Mr. Asquith had declared that the Government , as a Government , would not oppose the amendments , and this was a definite assurance upon which he absolutely relied , as should " every decent and candid citizen . " It was one thing to initiate and another thing to give the House of Commons the opportunity of discussion and without pressure , direct or indirect , to pass the measure . After the amendment had been passed the Govern- ment would adopt it as part of a Government measure and secure for it , if need be , the full advantage of the Parliament Act . This was quite enough for any Liberal and for any suffragist with a single - minded desire to secure the enfranchisement of women . He would not stand there and take part in any discussion which hinted that the Prime Minister was evading his pledge . " Cantankeroas gossips " might have another opinion , but no one who knew the Prime Minister would doubt him . If they united in the policy of the resolution , they had the most solid ground for expecting victory . The only risk lay in persistence in the policy of violence and outrage- " a policy we repudiate and con- demn . " It was plain to demonstration that such a policy did not com- mend itself to the House , to which they had to look for victory . Sir John then dealt with the amendments on the notice paper and appealed to Conservatives to co - operate with Liberal Suffragists , alluding to Lord Robert Cecil as " that honest and courageous Conservative . " MISS BONDFIELD made a rousing appeal from the point of view of the working woman . MISS I. O. FORD , who spoke for the National Union , made humorous reference to the " other opinions of the double - minded M.P.'s " mentioned by Sir John Simon . They talked of Democracy and Liberalism . What did they know of either ? MR . MUNRO , M.P. for Wigton drew attention to the resolution passed br the Scottish Liberal Association in favour of Women's Suffrage , and he regarded it as , under the ciircumstances , peculiarly significant . Several delegates made short speeches and the resolution was then put to the vote and declared carried unanimously , amid cheers . The editors of a great encyclop√¶dia , which appeared in the latter part of the eighteenth century , gave the following definition of Woman : - Woman , the Female of Man . See Man .

DECEMBER 6 , 1912 . Women's THE COMMON Interests Mr. The National Union and Dr. Martindale's Pamphlet . Readers of THE COMMON CAUSE will remember that , a fortnight ago , Lord Tullibardine asked the Home Secretary whether his attention had been called to an obscene pamphlet sold by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , and whether he would take steps to prohibit the further sale of it . McKenna replied that he had not been acquainted with the publi- cation until his attention had been called to it by Lord Tulli- bardine , and that he would consider it . His answer indicated that the pamphlet was then in his possession . This was on Thursday , November 21st . The little book in question , Dr. Martindale's " Under the Surface , " is very short ; any person could quickly read it through , and its character is clear enough upon the most cursory inspection . To call it " obscene " simply to misuse words . 1S On the subsequent Tuesday , when the question ought to have been asked again , it was passed over , and , as was stated last week in THE COMMON CAUSE , Lord Tullibardine said that it was postponed at the request of the Home Secretary . Thus for day after day the absolutely unfounded and discreditable accusation brought against the National Union remained uncontradicted . On Monday , December 2nd , Mrs. Fawcett wrote to the Home Secretary the following letter : - " On Thursday , November 21st , a question was addressed to you in the House by Lord Tullibardine about what he termed an obscene publication publicly sold at 14 , Great Smith Street , ' the offices of this Society . " No answer was given ; the question was postponed to Tuesday , November 26th . Again no answer was given . It is now eleven days since what amounts to an infamous charge was made against this Society , and it seems that we are to lie for an indefinite period under the intolerable insult implied in Lord Tullibardine's question . " I appeal to you to put an end to this state of things , and to give a definite answer to Lord Tullibardine's question with as little delay as possible . " I enclose a letter which I addressed a week ago to a group of M.P.s on this subject . I will only add here that since the question . was put in the House of Commons , I have received testimony from many quarters , from doctors , both men and women , and especially from workers in the cause of moral purity , as to the great value of the little book referred to . One very distinguished medical man said that if this book did not exist already , it would be necessary to get something of the same kind written by another author who combines , as Dr. Louisa Martindale does , the double qualification of scientific training and moral enthusiasm . " Late on Tuesday no reply had been received to this letter , but immediately upon its receipt the important question was put and answered . Lord Tullibardine , dropping his offensive adjective , asked whether steps had been taken to prohibit the sale of a pamphlet by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies to which his attention has been drawn . Mr. McKenna did not himself reply , but Mr. Ellis Griffith said : The Secretary of State is advised that the institution of proceedings would not be war- ranted in the case of this book " ; and Lord Tullibardine urged him further . Did the Home Secretary , he wished to know , con- sider the pamphlet decent , and was there no means of preventing such publications in which disgusting details were told from getting into the hands of young girls ? Mr. Griffith replied that the Home Secretary had no power to suppress a pamphlet of the kind . " The only power open to the Secretary of State is to institute a prosecution on the ground that the pamphlet is indecent or obscene . I am advised that a prosecution on these lines would not be successful . " Mr. Snowden , intervening , with an indignation that shows even through the dry record of Hansard , asked whether the Home Office accepted the insinua- tion that the work was full of disgusting details , and not fit to get into the hands of young persons . Mr. Griffith , very official , as Under - Secretaries are expected to be , said that the only ques- tion to be considered was whether it was indecent or obscene , and in the opinion of the Home Office , a prosecution founded on either of those assumptions would not be successful . Mr. Snowden pursued : " You think that the pamphlet is neither indecent nor obscene ? " We are advised , " repeated Mr. Griffith , " that if a prosecution were instituted , it would not be successful . " Lord Tullibardine tried again : " Is the pamphlet to be circulated in the schools of the country ? " Secretaries are not so easily caught . Mr. Griffith merely asked : " Do I understand the noble lord to advise this step ? to which his Lordship could but answer : Certainly not . Lord Robert Cecil interposed with a well - directed question . Was the honour- able gentleman aware that this was a pamphlet written by a very highly respected doctor in Brighton , and written in perfect good faith to warn persons of the consequences of a certain Act ? Mr. Robert Harcourt also asked by whom the Home Office had been advised . Was it by its legal adviser ? In answer to the < But Under- 99

CAUSE . in Parliament . 605 first question , Mr. Griffith said he thought it did express his own opinion , and in answer to the second that " we were advised by those who legally advise us . " This closed this incident , which we have reported in unusual detail in order that members of the Union may know exactly the nature of the attack made upon them . Nothing would have better served the purpose of Anti - Suffragist members of the House than a prosecution , on the grounds indicated , of a publica- tion sold by the National Union . But no such prosecution could possibly have been successful , and Lord Tullibardine could easily have discovered that fact by private consultation with the Home Office . But then , of course , the National Union would have received no damage . As things stand , the Union is handsomely acquitted - after eleven days ; and Dr. Martindale , who , in writing " Under the Surface , " performed a public service of which she found the execution extremely painful , has not only been exposed for ten days to an insult absolutely undeserved , but has had to endure its reiteration by the original insulter even after it had been declared unfounded . We hope it may make some amends to her to know how warmly grateful many women ( especially many mothers ) are for her pamphlet , and how deeply Lord Tulli- bardine's insinuations have been resented by hundreds of decent men and women . Foreign News . The United States . The real meaning of the amazing victory in the United States is only gradually being realised in this country . Indeed , American women themselves are surprised at the completeness of their success . For it means , as the Woman's Journal informs us , that 349,857 square miles have been added to the already vast extent of equal suffrage territory in the United States . " There is now a continuous chain of enfranchised States reaching north and south all the way from Canada to the Gulf , and east and west from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean . " It was the third time a Suffrage referendum had been taken in Kansas , and the number three proved lucky . In Arizona the women had a " walk - over . " In Oregon the question had been submitted again and again . The women refused to know when they were beaten and they were right , for victory came at last , and the result is said to show " the value of stick - to - it - iveness . A good lesson surely for other countries , too ! Michigan is an especial triumph , as it is the most populous State that has granted votes to women , and is entitled to even more votes in the electoral college than California . It is noteworthy that all the new suffrage States , except Michigan , border on States already enfranchised . The tendency has been for women's suf- rage to spread from State to State . " If it had made women unwomanly and home unhappy , it would not have been adopted by the men of those States which were the nearest neighbours . The facts speak for themselves . The Rev. Anna Shaw attri- butes the recent victories to the generally changed attitude of men towards this question , an attitude which this year included work for the cause as well as merely voting for it . In New York the victories were celebrated by a torchlight procession witnesed by half a million spectators . It took nearly two hours to pass a given point , and would have taken much longer had not the processionists marched in columns of fifteen and twenty instead of by twos and threes . According to the New York Times , " the parade was a line , miles long , of well- dressed , intelligent women , deeply concerned in the cause they are fighting for . . . the picture was that of a long river of fire , that , beginning somewhere north of St. Patrick's Cathedral , ended in a blazing display no less brilliant in Union Square , where the orators of the movement assembled at the close to tell why votes for women are just as good for New York as for California . " And we hear that New York is hopeful . At the annual meeting of the Central Committee of Poor Law Confer- ences , Miss I. M. Baker ( Holborn Board of Guardians ) was co - opted as member of the committee . Miss I. O. Ford asks us to note that constant confusion arises in the announcements of lectures delivered by herself and by her neice , Miss S. O. Ford , and after detailing some instances of trouble arising from this confusion , she says , " Will your readers remember that we are two people and not one ? "

Hon Treasurer : MRS . AUERBACH . Secretary : MISS CATHERINE MARSHALL mentary ) MISS EMILY M. LEAF ( Press ) . MISS GERALDINE COOKE Offices : Parliament Chambers , 14 , Great Smith Street , Westminster , London , W.C. Press Department . The Times has been attempting to create obstruction in the way of amendments to the Reform Bill by suggesting that the omission of the word " male " would rule subsequent amend- ments out of order . This point has been fully dealt with by Mrs. Swanwick in her letter to the Manchester Guardian on November 27th and 29th , and by Lord Robert Cecil in the Times on November 28th . The comments thrown out by the Parlia- mentary Correspondent of the Labour Leader with regard to the amount of support which the amendments command in the House , their probable fate , and the possibility of Mr. Asquith's resignation if they pass , show no evidence of having sprung from an authoritative source . In regard to this , we may point to the report in the Standard of Miss K. D. Courtney's speech at the Reception of the London Society on December 3rd . It contains a clear statement to the effect that the National Union has excellent authority for saying that there is no foundation whatever for the rumours that Mr. Asquith will resign if the amendments to enfranchise women are carried . In a few weeks it is stated that the Daily Citizen will be estab- lished in London , with a view to ensuring improved organisation for the task it has set itself , " of providing its supporters all over the country with a record of the deeds of Labour , and of strengthening the weak places of the movement by providing it with the history of success elsewhere . " The Daily Citizen has lately been fighting the battle of the women in the Black Country , and will readily admit that the weakest point in the conditions of Labour at the present moment is to be found in the fact that half the population is unenfranchised . The Labour Party in the House of Commons is prepared to use its whole strategy in the direction of securing the inclusion of women in the Reform Bill , and we welcome the advent of the Daily Citizen to London in the hope that fuller opportunities will be given for adequate representation in the Press of the fight which is being undertaken by the men and women whose party it represents . G. M. LEAF . Treasurer's Notes . The expenses of the Bow and Bromley Election have been unexpectedly heavy . The rapidity of the campaign necessitated almost continuous printing , bill - posting , and the holding of a concentrated number of meetings , and the high cost of halls makes an election in the metropolis more expensive than in the provincial towns . Many readers will be interested to know that we have received a donation for the Bow and Bromley election from Miss Bertha Mason , who was the writer of the letter quoted last week . Perhaps her example will encourage others who share ber feelings to send us donations for the very fine work done during the contest , and as a token of admiration for Mr. Lansbury's courage and sincerity . Suffragists should bear in mind the way in which large sums of money are being spent by the National Union . Our work for the next few weeks will , of course , be concentrated on shedding the clearest possible light on the Women's Suffrage amendments to the Government Reform Bill . This means a great deal of special effort in organising postcard campaigns , deputations , and memorials to members of Parliament ; we also undertake a constant distribution of literature dealing with this subject , besides which we are sending out an increased number of capable organisers in all directions on the special mission of enlightening the public and helping them to understand the situation . Especially we want the public to realise that the honour and prestige of parliamentary government in this country will depend upon the manner in which the House of Commons is allowed to face the coming issue .

There are many Sisterhoods and Brotherhoods , Mothers ' Meetings and Mothers ' Unions , which engage the attention of women interested in our work who are thus unable to spare time for more meetings .

608 News from London Society . The annual meeting of the London Society , took place at Caxton Hall on November 29th under the chairman- ship of the president , the Lady Frances Balfour . The President , who was received with enthusiasm , touched on the terrible harm now being done by the intereference with the postal pillar boxes - probably the action of militant suffragists - expressed cordial appreci- ation of the work of the N.U.W.S.S. organisers , and earnestly recommended a steady continuance of work along the lines laid down by the Union . Mrs. G. Dykes Spicer and the Hon . Mrs. Spencer Graves spoke on the report and revenue account , the latter making an appeal for more financial support to meet the rapidly growing work of the Society , especially in the poorer parts of London . The re - appointment of Miss Clugston proposed by Miss Alice Dimock , seconded by Miss Crook- enden and carried . was The following resolution was put : -That in Rule 5 , after the words " at the Annual Meeting , " and before the words the Committee shall elect , ' be inserted the following words : " In case of vacancies occurring in the Executive Committee during its year of office , it shall have power to fill them by co - option . This was proposed by Miss O'Malley and seconded by Miss Rosamond Smith . Both speakers based their arguments upon the practical advantages of being able to co - opt a suitable worker in case of an unexpected vacancy . Miss Edith Dimock made a vigorous speech in opposi- tion , but after a few words from Miss Helen Ward and a well - reasoned speech from Miss Emily Davies , the motion was put and carried by a considerable majority . The resolution " That in view of the increasing work and the consequent great length of the Committee Meetings , and also to ensure prompt attention to communications received , it is advisable that when possi- ble the Executive Committee should meet twice in each month , " stood in the names of Mrs. Theodore Williams and Miss Emily Davies , but owing to the absence of Mrs. Williams , it was proposed by Miss Davies , and seconded by Miss Spicer . The motion was put and carried . Mrs. Fawcett , who was received with prolonged ap- plause , said that although unable to find time to continue to sit upon the London Executive Committee , she retained all her interest in and appreciation of its work , and should continue to do for it all that she had done in the past . She also paid a warm tribute to Miss Strachey's organising gifts . Mrs. Fawcett then reviewed the progress of the movement and set forth the present position . The meeting closed with an account of the Bow and Bromley by - election from Miss Helen Ward . No ballot took place for the Executive Committee as the three vacancies , occasioned by the retirement of Mrs. Fawcett , Mrs. Longsdon and Miss Spicer were filled by three new nominations . The Executive stood elected as fol- lows : -Miss H. D. Cockle , Mrs. Stanton Ciot , Miss Emily Davies , LL.D. , Miss Edith Dimock , Miss Emily Hill , Miss Lowndes , Miss B. Newcombe , Miss I. B. O'Malley , Miss Edith Palliser , Miss A. Maude Royden , Miss R. Smith , Mrs. S. Spring Rice , Miss J. H. Thomson , Miss Helen Ward , Mrs. Theodore Williams , with Miss Eve , Mrs. L. B Franklin and Mrs. Gimingham . The Lady Frances Balfour , President and The Honourable Mrs. Spencer Graves , Treasurer , also stand re - elected . A. H. W. The Federations . Eastern Counties . CAMBRIDGE . - On November 25th the Newnham College Political Debating Society discussed the following motion : " That this House considers it to be the duty of the Labour party , under existing political conditions , to vote against the Government , unless and until they undertake to include women in the Reform Bill . " Two prominent members of the W.S.P.U. sup- ported the motion , and it was opposed on behalf of the N.U.W.S.S. by Miss Ord and Miss Woodham Smith . After three - quarters of an hour's debate the voting was taken , and the motion was defeated by 41 votes to 18 Nevertheless , members of the National Union were by no means satisfied with the course of the debate , and . were glad that a meeting for the explanation of the new policy had been arranged for the 28th , for which Mrs. Annot Robinson had been secured . The latter speaker showed clearly how the new policy had evolved from the old , how it was the most effective form of " militancy , " because it succeded in turning votes . She urged the advantages of a constructive policy at elec- tion times as compared with a negative Anti - Govern- ment policy , which was useless when organised by a voteless body . After the meeting a collection for the Election Fighting Fund realised over 10s . Manchester and District . We are asked to state that a paragraph which ap- peared in the last issue referring to the resignation of Mrs. Barnes ought to have read thus : " Mrs. Barnes has had to resign the Honorary Secretaryship owing to ill - health , and Miss Margaret Robertson has left Manchester to become Special Organiser for the Election Fighting Fund of the National Union . " South Wales and Monmouth . Since our last report Mrs. Sibbering Jones and the Barry Committee have been very active in organising an American Tea . This entertainment , the first of the kind given by the Society , proved a most effective means of making money ¬£ 6 being realised . Miss Barker , M.A. , gave a short address on this occasion . Five drawing - room meetings have been held this month , given respectively by Mrs. Bruer , the Misses Hooper , Mrs. Kyle , five members of the Society , and Mrs. Frank Murrel . The speakers were Miss Helen Fraser and Mrs. Corbett Ashby . At the last meeting 23 new members joined the Society . Miss Foxley , M.A. , has spoken at two debates at the Barry Congregational Church and

THE COMMON CAUSE . the Societies and the Cathays I.L.P. Debating Society . On Nov. 22nd Miss Townsend , of Bristol , gave an address in Cardiff on " Training in Motherhood - a National Need . " This was one of a series of three lectures arranged by the Society . The course terminated on December 2nd , with Mrs. George Morgan on the Criminal Law Amendment Bill . On November 28th , Miss Barke , M.A. addressed a meeting of the Midwives ' Association . CARDIFF . - On October 3rd a lecture was given in the Y.M.C.A. by Mrs. Mackirdy ( Olive Christian Mal- very ) on the White Slave Traffic when the hall was crowded . On November 5th and 9th Miss Frazer spoke at district and drawing - room meetings . On November 6th a public meeting was held in the Albany Road Council School . Dr. T. Wallace took the chair , and Miss Fraser gave an address on Woman Suffrage . District meetings and drawing - room meetings were addressed in November by Mrs. Corbett Ashby . A Lecture was given on Novem- ber 22nd by Miss Townsend at the Y.M.C.A. Hall on " A National Need . " The particular need considered was the difficult question of how best to train women for motherhood . MERTHYR . On November 4th Miss Fraser gave an address at the Tydfil Hall . The President , Mrs. Peter Williams , was in the chair . The subject of the address was " Women and Social Questions . " A resolution was afterwards proposed from the chair calling upon the members for Merthyr Tydfil to do all in their power to have women included in an amendment to the Reform Bill , and also that they do not favour any further male franchise which does not include women . The resolution was seconded by Mrs. Edwards , Courtland House , and carried unanimously . At the close of the meeting the Secretary enrolled 15 new members . The Society now numbers 110 . SWANSEA On October 12th a deputation was received by Sir Alfred Mond , M.P. , a staunch supporter of women's suffrage . He will vote for the omission of the word " male " before " persons " in Clause 1. Section I of the Franchise Bill , and for any or all of the amend- ments . But he refuses to pledge himself to vote against the third reading of the Bill if no women are included in it , as such a course might possibly involve the ultimate failure of the Welsh Disestablishment Bill . On October 21st a drawing - room meeting was held in the Unitarian Schoolroom by Miss Dillwyn , who was at home to some 70 guests , members of the N.U.S.S. and others . Miss Fraser was the chief speaker . A resolution was put to the meeting by the Rev. Simon Jones that the Government be urged to leave out Clause 1 of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill in its original form . This was carried unanimously . Eighteen new members were added to the Society . West of England . WINCHCOMBE . - This branch was very busy during the months of September and October preparing for a deputation to Mr. Hicks - Beech , and conducting a canvass of the members of various local party executives in order to get resolutions passed or letters written to the member . The results of the canvass , both among the Conservatives and the Liberals , were on the whole . encouraging . On November 15th the Executive of the Winchcombe Liberal Association passed unanimously a resolution in favour of the incorporation in the Franchise Bill of a " wide " measure of women suffrage , a result which was all the more gratifying because we had been warned , prior to the canvass , that the chance that our resolution would be carried was very remote indeed . Copies of the resolution have been sent to Mr. Asquith , Mr. Illingworth , Mr. Redmond , Mr. Hicks - Beech and Mr. Mathias , Liberal Candidate for the division . On October 22nd our Committee passed a resolution , copies of which were sent to Mr. Redmond and the two chief Whips , in favour of the Snowden Amendment to the Reform Bill . We have had some fresh members this Autumn , and we hope to have a good meeting in January . Scottish . November has been a busy month in the Edinburgh office , and throughout our whole district we have held a series of meetings which has left no section untouched . On November 1st , Mrs. Shaw McLaren spoke at the office on the " Position of Women in India , " and the I.L.P. , at Ardmillan Terrace , Edinburgh , was addressed on November 3rd by Miss Alice Low , who dealt with the need of the vote as a means of improving the position of women employed in industry . Miss Isabella Rowlette , who is so well known to members of the N.U.W.S.S. in Manchester , gave a delightful speech full of Irish humour called " Woman's Suffrage : What Good Will it Do ? " Miss Gordon is to speak there early in December . fortunate enough to have secured Miss Royden for a week in November . On the 11th she began her tour with a drawing - room meeting given by Miss Ella Sutherland , in Granby Road . The audience was sympathetic , four new members joined the society , and many others were confirmed in their beliefs . On November 12th . a large public meeting took place in Springvalley Halls , Morningside , under the chairman- ship of Councillor Rusk . Miss Royden appealed to the audience on behalf of those who were the sweated workers . We were Mr. Charles Robertson , Innerleithen , made an excellent speech , from the man's point of view , and stated that he had never come across one argument against the justice of the women's cause . Councillor Young , who is well known as a Labour champion of woman's suffrage , said that he had twice voted for Mr. Lyell , but had not known that he was against women's suffrage . Mr. Lyell would never get his vote again . Nine new members were gained at this meeting , and four " Friends . " The " Evening News " devoted a column to a report of the meeting , and the editor of the paper was seen in the audience . The Auditorium . Bo'ness , where an appreciative audience awaited Miss Royden , was the scene of a suc- cessful meeting organised by Miss Kate Andrew and others . The chair was taken by Mr. W. A. Denholm , two new members were enrolled , and a meeting was promised for Linlithgow . The society's first public meeting at Bathgate took place at the Co - operative Hall , on November 14th .

DECEMBER 6 , 1912 . Federations . Robertson was in the chair , and the speakers were Miss Royden and Miss Low . The hall was well filled . On November 15th , the office room could hardly con- tain the large crowd which assembled to hear Miss Royden's speech on the election policy of the National Union , Miss S. E. S. Mair being in the chair . Four new members joined the society , and many papers and much literature was sold . Miss Royden then proceeded to Musselburgh , where she addressed a large audience . On November 18th Mrs. Guyer had a good meeting at the Warrender Wark Branch of the B.W.T.A. , and on the afternoon of the 22nd she spoke at the office on " Indirect Influence or Direct - Which ? " As always , her address was full of good things . Our first meeting at Dalkeith since the election was a small , but extremely enthusiastic one , and was com- posed principally of electors . Miss Low and Miss Gor- don were the speakers . The Women's Freedom League organised a large Demonstration in the Central Hall on November 22nd . The Edinburgh Society sold tickets at their office , and The hall , which provided stewards for the meeting . holds two thousand , was packed , and the speakers re- ceived a most attentive hearing . Mrs. Despard , Dr. Elsie Inglis , the Rev. Dr. Drummond and the Rev. Mr. Benson all spoke , and Judge Stevenson occupied the chair . The whole tone of the meeting was extremely good . An excellent little meeting was held on the afternoon of November 23rd , Miss Low and Miss Gor- don being the speakers . Some of the audience walked . all the way from Mid and East Calder , and several new members joined the society , the branch raising its membership to 28. Livingston is a tiny village in the Lord Advocate's constituency , and we are very proud of it , and of its secretary , Miss Traill . On November 29th , Miss Alice Low spoke at the office on the text , " Don't be Pessimistic , " and dispelled the ugly rumours which had appeared of late in the papers . to the effect that the amendments to the Reform Bill would be ruled out of order if they were framed to admit women . Among other pieces of useful work in which members of the society have taken part was the second of the series of meetings for working women , organised by Mrs. Shaw McLaren , at which Mrs. Despard spoke and Miss Alice Low was the chairman . 20 new " Friends " joined the Union after the meeting . Much of the time of the organisers has of late been occupied in arrangements for the great Demonstration to be held on December 9th in St. Andrew's Halls , Glas- gow , at which Lord Lytton , Miss Royden and others will speak ; in preparations for our supplementary sale on December 10th , and for the theatricals on January 17th , when Miss Jean Pagan and Miss Carmouche are to pro- duce Miss Cicely Hamilton's play , " Just to get Married . " Tickets are now ready , and we shall be very glad of any volunteers to sell them . Miss Rachel Jeffrey , who has been appointed secretary for the " Friends of Woman Suffrage , " is unceasing in her efforts to make the scheme a success . Miss Moody and Mrs. Philips are doing admirable work as secretaries for the COMMON CAUSE , but would be glad of assistance in selling the paper at meetings and in the street . By the kindness of Miss Evelyn Simson we have been able to get posters of the paper displayed at both railway stations . The Press work is in the capable hands of Mrs. Guyer . We must specially note a letter from Miss Loudon in answer to one from Professor Knight , and a spirited criticism of the disquieting rumours which were appearing from time to time about the Woman's Suffrage amendments to the Reform Bill from Mr. W. Lowson . We appeal to all friends to go with us to Glasgow for the meeting on December 9th . Tickets for the special train may be had from our offices at two - and - sixpence each . The train will leave Waverley at six - thirty - two , and will stop at Linlithgow and Falkirk to pick up members of the Union in those places . ALICE LOW LISA M. GORDON ( Organisers ) . ORGANISER'S REPORT . - The Glasgow Society is extremely busy just now with its winter campaign . As a result of its activities during the last month about a hundred new members have joined , and ¬£ 86 has been received as subscriptions or donations . Miss Watson , our energetic organiser , has addressed ten drawing - room meetings during November , at Mrs. Albert Gray's Mrs. Peter Rintoul's , Mrs. McTaggart's , Miss Muir's , Miss Rankin's , Mrs. Watson's and Miss Neilson's . Great enthusiasm was expressed at all the meetings , and many new members joined . Miss Stuart Paterson has also spoken at the Young Street United Free Church Literary Society and at meetings of the Women's Co- operative Guild . Our great effort for the month was the meeting on November 11th in the Christian Insti- tute , to consider the religious aspect of the woman's movement . The Very Rev. Dr. McAdam Muir , of Glas- gow Cathedral , took the chair , and the speakers included Miss Frances Stirling , Rev. Provost Deane , of St. Mary's , Rev. Dr. Drummond , Rev. Dr. Hunter , Rev. Norman McNeill and others . Altogether there were over fifty clergy on the platform . The Hall , which holds nearly 1,000 , was crowded , and an overflow meeting had to be held in another room . The attitude of the Church in Glasgow to the Women's Suffrage question is becoming quite satisfactory . The Rev. Henry Taylor , Sydney Place U. F. Church , gave a lecturen on November 24th " The Soul Market ; or , the Unknown Tragedy of Women's Labour , " when he stated that the only cure for sweated labour , drink , and the terrible lives of our women workers was the vote The series of office " At Homes " was begun on November 15th , when Miss Brownlee read a paper on " Woman under the Roman Empire . " The second meeting was held on November 21st , Mrs. Hunter giving an address on " Vigilance Work . " A new Parliamentary Sub - Committee has been formed in St. Rollox . This is the fourth organised as yet . Our energies are being directed at present upon the great Demonstration to be held in the St. Andrew's Halls on December 9th . The Lady Frances Balfour will be in the chair , and the speakers will be Viscountess Castlereagh , Miss Maude Royden , The Earl of Lytton , and Professor Latta . Many voluntary workers are giving their services for the requisite organisation . on We are informed that the new society at Ross , men- tioned in our last issue , has not joined the West Midland Federation .

DECEMBER 6 , 1912 . DEPUTATION TO MR . CHIOZZA MONEY , M.P. On Friday November 29th , at the Liberal Club , Ket- tering , Mr. Chiozza Money ( Lib . ) M.P. for East Northants , received a Deputation arranged by the Kettering Branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and the Kettering Women's Liberal Association . The members of the Deputation who were representative of the constituency , were introduced by Mr. R. B. Wallis , Vice - President of the East Northants Central Liberal Association . Miss Chrystal Macmillan , Member of the Executive of the N.U.W.S.S. , spoke for the National Union . She thanked Mr. Money for what he had done in the past for Women's Suffrage , and asked him to do his utmost to get some measure of enfranchisement for women included in the Bill . Miss Macmillan then pre- sented a memorial signed by the presidents of the principal Societies , etc. , by professional men and others of influence in all classes in East Northants . Short speeches followed , from Mr. A. Wallis on behalf of the Women's Liberal Association , from the Hon . Sec . of the Kettering Women's Labour League , and from Mr. W. Sharman and Mr. Bradfield ( Hon . Treas . East Northants Liberal Association ) for Wellingborough and Rushden respectively . In replying , Mr. Money said he was glad of the oppor- timity of stating his views on the question . He was an Adult Suffragist . Therefore he would be only too happy to vote for Amendment I. to omit the word " male " from Clause I. , sub - section 1 , of the Bill , and for Amendment II . to enfranchise women on the same terms as men . Amendent III . , which would give the vote to women householders and wives of male householders , he also considered democratio and he would willingly vote for it , but Amendment IV . , on the lines of the Conciliation Bill , which , as he at present understood , would enfran- chise women householders only , he could not support . This Amendment was , in his opinion , undemocratic , as it would give the vote to one class of women only . He was , however , open to conviction and if it could be proved by statistics that this would not be the case , he would reconsider his decision . Miss Macmillan said she would be glad to send Mr. Money statistics to show that Amendment IV would enfranchise some women of all classes , the working woman equally with others . The deputation was con- cluded with thanks to Mr. Money for his reception and for the promises he had given . The memorial to Mr. Money , the work of Miss Ballan- tine , assistant organiser in the East Midland Federation area , contained 365 signatures . SUFFRAGE DEBATE AT CLEVEDON . A largely attended Public debate was held on Novem- ber 22nd , when Miss Gladys Pott opposed Miss Helen Fraser , Dr. Visger presided . Miss Fraser proposed the resolution " That the Parliamentary vote should be extended to qualified women . " The audience was repre sentative . Miss Pott based her opposition , broadly speaking , on the statements that ( 1 ) Women do not need the vote ; ( 2 ) would not make good voters , " and ( 3 ) upon the physical force argument . Miss Fraser's treat- ment of the last point was particularly effective , and her final appeal for women's share in the betterment of the State evoked hearty approval . The resolution was carried by 171 votes to 132 , a majority of 39 , a large number besides not voting . " Irish Notes . to The Earl of Dunraven , Chairman of the " Moderate Party " Committee organised for the endeavour reconcile conflicting views on the Home Rule Bill , has consented to receive a deputation from the Irishwomen's Suffrage Federation . There is good hope that this committee may take into serious consideration the claims of Irishwomen to enfranchisement ; several members have written expressing their sympathy with these claims . A Memorial addressed by constituents to Irish Mem- bers of Parliament has been drafted and members of the Federation will be asked to obtain the signatures of influential people : it is hoped that Irish suffragists will spare no effort to make this Memorial thoroughly repre- sentative . Miss Day , the Hon . Secretary of the Munster Women's Franchise Association , has already received very generous response to her plea for financial support . It is satisfactory to be able to report that this League s now in a position to open an office in a central position in Cork . The Limerick Suffrage Society is re - organising itself . Miss Day and Mrs. Cowan ( Hon . Secretary of the Birr Society ) will be the speakers at a meeting there on December 8th , after which it is hoped that the Society will formally affiliate with the Federation . The Hon . Helen MacNaghten organised the meeting held at Bush- mills , Co. Antrim , November 27th , with Miss Eva MacNaghten as speaker , which was the first meeting of the newly organised Bushmills Society . The Irishwomen's Reform League has many activities on hand . On December 27th a variety entertainment will be given in the Molesworth Hall , and on November 28th a subscription ball will be held in the Pillar Room of the Rotunda , one of the leading spirits in the organisa- tion being Miss Moser . The Metropolitan Players are giving performances of Ibsen's " Lady from the Sea " and " Little Eyolf " on December 9th , 10th and 11th , in aid of the funds of the Irishwomen's Reform League . A Christmas Fair will be held by the Irishwomen's Reform League at 29 , South Anne Street , on December 19th , 20th and 21st . The committee hope for contri- butions of all kinds from fresh eggs to books . The League have on sale a Christmas calendar and Christmas card specially designed by an Irish artist , and it is hoped that Irishwomen in England will encourage Irish suffra- gists artists by sending orders to 29 , South Anne Street , Dublin .

Miss Gladys Pott , in her correspondence with Mr. Coote in the Standard , stated that she had been asked to work for the " Pass the Bill " Committee , but , un- fortunately , the correspondence was closed before any question or reply could follow . As a member of the committee , I was anxious to discover in what way she had been able to help us , for although as a non - party organisation we have made every effort to elicit help from the anti suftragists , there has not been to my knowledge a very mar ed response , and if one can judge by press cuttings their meetings have not been numerous on the White Slave Traffic . Miss Pott refers to our meeting of July 10th as being openly suffrage , but if she had been present she would have heard Miss Violet Markham's sympathetic letter read in response to our invitation to speak . We have always given equal opportunities to all societies to join with us , and it is to her own members that Miss Pott should apply if she wishes to know why suffragists preponderate in our demonstrations . The fact is that Miss Pott recognises the inevitable connection between the demand for the vote and the desire for social reform , just as Mrs. Humphry Ward has discovered that most leading teachers and educationalists are suffragists . It is not the result of any dark con- spiracy ; it is a natural coincidence . The Pass the Bill Committee was formed by the spontaneous coming together of a small group of women who wished to work for the abolition of the White Slave Traffic . No qualification was made , no questions were asked , and if there are more suffragists on it than anti - suffragists , it is only because the anti - suffragists did not come in larger numbers to initiate the work . KATHERINE VULLIAMY . THE NATIONAL UNION AND MILITANCY . Surely it is time for the National Union to reconsider its attitude of calm acceptance of militant methods . Owing to a high sense of loyalty the Union , as a society , keeps quiet and neutral ; if , as rarely happens , it dis- approves mildly on one hand , it gives a little encouraging pat with the other . Helen A paragraph in Miss Ward's article , " Bow and Bromley Election , " illus- trates what I mean . The militants throw over friends , relations and , incidentally , ordinary decency , for the ( according to them ) sake of the Cause . Cannot the Constitutional Suffragists , also for the sake of the Cause , come forward in a body and boldly and openly denounce these people who in a few months have undone the work of years ? It might have been better for women's suffrage if the National Union had withdrawn its workers from Bow and Bromley and had left Mr. Lansbury ( a militant ) to his militant supporters . The public would then have realised , as it cannot possibly do now , that the National Union does not approve of militancy -H . [ Our correspondent's view of the National Union's attitude is singularly erroneous . Not once , but scores of times , has the Union publicly declared its disapproval of militant tactics and its conviction that they are damaging to the cause which they are meant to pro- mote . In the case of the Bow and Bromley election the National Union was acting according to its long- established policy of supporting the best friend of women's suffrage . The presence in the field of other supporters of Mr. Lansbury would not have justified a withdrawal on the National Union's part - especially as the methods of those others were in this election perfectly peaceful and constitutional . - ED . C.C. ] . THE " DICKINSON " OR " GREY " AMENDMENT While canvassing for signatures to a petition to one of our local members of Parliament , asking him to support one or other of the possible amendments to the Franchise Bill for the inclusion of women as voters , I came across as often before , the objection felt by male voters , to granting the vote to married women , wives of house- holders . Even some of those who profess themselves , in a general way , not unfavourable to the extension of the suffrage to women , strongly demur to this amendment , and give it as a reason for declining to sign the petition . The reason urged is the common one , the fear that difference of political opinion would lead to dissension between husband and wife . Further , the proposal that no women shall be re- gistered as joint occupiers in respect of the same dwelling , while the vote should be granted both to man and wife , as joint occupiers , seems to some , an injustice . As far as I understand the true significance of that seems an anomaly , it is this : The claim of married women to the vote rests on the recognition of the equal share of responsibility of the husband and wife , for the household and for their children . In the case of women related to each other by ties of blood , or living together by choice as joint occupiers of a house , these special and equal responsibilities do not exist . An agreement to share common expenses stands on a totally different footing to the nature of the contract for common responsibilities in marriage as it is understood by the men and women of to - day . The amendment seeks to establish the fact that a woman is not disqualified by marriage for all citizen- MARY S. TALBOT . ship .

609 CHARLTON GOWNS LINGERIE BLOUSES 53 , Manchester Street , W. AND 1 , Lower Seymour Street , W. Telephone : 1916 MAYFAIR . Artistic Calendars and Christmas Cards . The Women Writers ' Suffrage League , Goschen Buildings , 12 and 13 , Henrietta Street W.C. , are selling calendars and Christmas cards of a distinctly pleasing and inexpensive kind . Combined with a beauty of colour , drawing , and general finish , the verses inscribed upon them possess a literary value which differen- tiates them from the usual milk - and - water senti- ment of Christmas mottoes . One little calendar , price 2d . , in black and white , includes Lawrence Housman's verses , " Woman's Cause , " and a well - coloured reproduction of W. H. Marget- son's picture of " Justice and Prejudice , " with a quotation from the same poem , by Lawrence Housman , makes for the low price of 3d . an excellent Christmas card . Miss Sybil Tawse , 19 , Gloucester Road , S.W. , was showing her calendars , prints and cards at the Englishwoman Exhibition , and her stall there was a particularly attractive place . Until Christmas Miss Tawse will be showing in her studio at Gloucester Road a selection of the cards and calendars that she has designed and had printed and has coloured herself by hand . Specially to be admired are three " bedroom " cards , one , in quiet tones , of a girl drawing her window curtains aside . Underneath is written the well - known verse beginning , " Sleep sweet within this quiet room . The other two are on the same subject , and are a large and a small drawing of a decoratively treated 16th century four - post bed - in which sleeps a young girl watched over by four angels . The picture illustrates the old words , beginning " " Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , Guard the bed that I lie on . " Among are of the Christmas cards , two Kensington Gardens , and illustrate the G. F. Watts statue of " Physical Energy and the Another is a new statue of " Peter Pan . " pleasing treatment of the Madonna and Child , and perhaps one of the most charming is one of a light figure playing pipes amidst the foliage of a rose - bush . There are also two large the four illustrating four - leaf calenders ,

THE ARTISTS ' SUFFRAGE LEAGUE has forwarded us copies of their new Christmas card , which bears the inspiring motto : " Winning would put any man into courage .
