I should like to congratulate the people who have been carrying on the organisa- tion while the leaders have been harassed and imprisoned and generally driven from pillar to post . It is a good , healthy sign that the movement which the Women's Social and Political Union stands for has a real hold and backing amongst women , that you have been able to stand as deter- minedly as you have done all through this very trying period . doubtful indeed if a men's movement would have stood all the banging about that your movement has , and through it with such cheerful spirits as you have done . can can I am very come to people , It is a very strange commentary on what is being said in the House of Com- mons and in Ulster , that men like Sir Edward Carson and Lord Londonderry not merely stir up others to kill break windows, but and yet be honoured guests of the King .",,['Mr. George Lansbury'],,,"May 10, 1912"
