# Known Errors
## Common Causes

Checked LJ: 1, 3, 4, 11, 29, 130, 159, 165, 200

Checked  VR: 13, 167, 27, 84, 50, 184, 108, 221, 177

Notes: 
- 184 picked up two extra meetings from other suffrage societies that were listed next to the "forthcoming events"(minor error IMO).
- 221 picked up additional meetings because the list was very short (1 meeting). The meetings picked up are mostly relevant (although some come from other societies), and come from free text descriptives of meetings from the "News of Societies and Federations". Still OK in my book.
- 177 has a typo (OCR error, OK): "Orieff" in csv should be "Crieff"
- 
### 200
Also picks up the table of "Coming events" which might also be relevant.

## VFW
Checked: 100 (meetings are scattered in small tables and seems like it is correctly picked up)

## Suffragettes
Checked: 26, 39

### 39
Page in the background with some readable text messes up the clustering. Had to manually crop.
Picks up some events scattered in the text.
