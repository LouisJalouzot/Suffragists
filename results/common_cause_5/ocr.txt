494 THE The News of the Week . A Warning . COMMON Mr. Brailsford , in a letter to the " Nation , " shows very clearly the difficulties and dangers which will beset the Women's Suffrage question in the event of the Liberals being again returned to power , and it behoves Suffragists to be on their guard and do their utmost , when the time comes , to improve their position . A promise " not to oppose a measure which only a minority will vote for is a somewhat barren promise . Suffragists must improve upon it . The Rossendale Candidate . Mr. Arthur K. Bulley , head of Messrs . S. M. Bulley and Son , cotton brokers , Liverpool , is the candidate of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and other Workers ' Representation Committee . He is 48 years old , and is a member of the Social Democratic Party and the Fabian Society . He lives at Neston , Cheshire , where he has a beautiful garden , and he is himself a keen and expert gardener . At the entrance to his grounds is a board , with the inscription , " All are welcome . " The National Union has resolved to help Mr. Bulley's candi- dature , and several societies have also offered workers and speakers . Mr. Harcourt's anti - suffragism is of a peculiarly contemptible and insolent sort , and we wish Mr. Bulley all success . The women operatives are in great numbers in this constituency , yet , when they asked Mr. Harcourt to give a civil reason why he was opposed to Women's Suffrage , he merely replied , " I am , because I am . One can scarcely conceive of more canting humbug than that of a man who goes about talking of democracy and yet can give so arrogant an answer to the people , when they happen to be women . Labour Members ' Salaries . The question which was to have been decided last week before the House of Lords as to whether Trade Unions are legally justified in making compulsory levies upon their members for the purpose of returning Labour representatives to Parliament , and afterwards paying salaries to the representatives elected , has been post- poned , but the judgment is expected on Tuesday . This is a question of great moment to women operatives , whose money is taken willy - nilly to pay for a member who may make it no part of his business to represent the women , and who actually more than once has proved very indifferent to the women's interests . It does not strikÄ— one as very fair play to take the women's money and turn a deaf ear to their needs , but as things are now the women cannot help themselves , since the money is not raised by a special levy , which the unrepresented might refuse , but is taken out of Union funds . Canadian Women . The Toronto " World " recently had a very strong article on the low standard of political morals , and pointed out the total neglect of a vast power for good , namely , the women . The World " believes " the hour has now come to call in the women of Canada to redress the political , electoral , and social evils from which the country suffers . " An Anti - Suffrage Petition . Lord Denman's speech has suggested to a correspondent the following petition for the Women's Anti - Suffrage League : " Whereas , by the Grace of God those marvel- lous beings commonly known as Persons of the Male Sex are endowed with all wisdom , knowledge and under- standing , and whereas we , the women of this country , are so poor and mean - spirited and ignorant we cannot be trusted to register our votes , or if we can be trusted to do so , our representatives in Parliament are such knaves or fools , they cannot be trusted to carry out the instructions we give them , therefore we , your - petitioners , humbly pray that all political power in this country may continue to be centred in the aforesaid Persons of the Male Sex , their male heirs and successors , whether they be wise men or utterly incapable , because ,

" " This funny little monthly reproaches Mrs. Fawcett and the National Union with not caring " very much for the fact that the country to which its members belong is face to face with perhaps the gravest problems which have confronted Englishmen for well - nigh two generations . ' But it is Mrs. Fawcett and the members of the National Union who say that these problems interest them so much and seem to them so vital that they can scarcely endure to be left out when they are being decided ; and it is the Anti - Suffragists who say women are not interested and are not fit to be consulted on these problems . Surely the writer must have forgotten her- self and thought she was reproaching the Anti - Suffragists . The motto they recommend , " Our country first and our sex second , " strikes us as a contradiction in terms . " Our country is composed of women as well as men , and what the Anti - Suffragists mean is , " Men first and women nowhere . " The " Review " mentions with approval Mrs. Harrison's very futile article in the " Nineteenth Century , " and actually picks out the mani- festly ridiculous statement that " whatever feeling there might have been in the country " before 1905 has been effectually cooled . " The prodigious increase in the membership and incomes of Suffrage Societies is sufficient " comment . Women in South Africa . All sorts of queer anomalies are coming to light now that the Union is making a renaissance among the women . In the Cape Colony , we are told , women vote both at the Municipal and School Board Elections ; they may sit on School Boards , but not on Town Councils . In the Transvaal they may stand for School Board Elections , but may not vote ; they may vote for Municipal candi- dates but may not stand . Oh , logical man ! It almost seems as if he were ruled by accident , caprice , prejudice , - by anything but reason . The Labour Exchanges and Women . It is announced that the Board of Trade will shortly proceed to the appointment of a certain number of women officers in the Labour Exchanges . Most of these will be required as registration clerks , but there will be a limited number of more responsible posts involving organisation and supervision . No request for a form of application can be considered if received after the 31st inst . Letters should be addressed to the Secretary of the Board of Trade . The New Union for Men and Women . This Union had its first annual meeting last week at Anderton's Hotel . The officers and committee were re- elected , and the general election policy decided to be one of censure on the Government . This makes the third Union whose policy is to oppose the Government , in contradistinction to the National Union , which neither opposes nor supports any party as such . The I.L.P. At the special Conference to determine the election policy of the I.L.P. , one of the " planks " in the policy was stated to be " the full and equal citizenship of men and women . " Our Front Page . We are afraid our readers will hardly consider our front page pretty enough to be a Christmas card , but no one can deny that it is " seasonable . " It is a rough facsimile of a poster designed by Miss Robertson , which the North of England Society is supplying to those who apply in time . The dimensions are 120 inches by 80 inches . Apply to Miss Courtney , 85 , Deansgate Arcade , Manchester . It is not necessary to print good wishes upon it , for it carries these wishes to all women and all men , even to the Anti - Suffragists who will use the vote when we have got it for them .

Lords Cromer and Curzon are two of the pillars of the Anti - Suffrage League . Lord Curzon has been defending the hereditary principle and maintaining not only that there is , but that there should be considerable import- ance attached to the circumstance that a man is " the son of his father . " But we know that ability is not handed down in tail male , and it seems a curious thing that one so ready to maintain the hereditary principle of a " governing caste " should not recognize that , as likely as not , Nature will play the trick of handing on a great statesman's qualities to his daughter , who is debarred by our present system from making the fullest use of those qualities ; she must find some man , inferior to herself , that she may use him as a tool . Lord Curzon regards the position of the Lords as being enviable because they are not pestered by crotchet mongers running round with deputations " ( here , we feel sure , he will have the sym- pathy of Mr. Asquith ) ; moreover , they are not CC bound by pledges so often rashly given and at a later date most reluctantly redeemed " ( did not Lord Crewe recently say much the same thing ? Many candidates will now be wishing they too were Lords ) . Lord Curzon spoke with considerable approval of the caste system of society as obtaining in India , and we have not forgotten that it is his League which advances as an argument for the con- tinued political subjection of women in England , that our Indian subjects would cease to respect us if women were free . They do not seem to see that this is an argument for the harem and seclusion of women . Lord Cromer has been startling a world which had innocently supposed that the Budget and the House of Lords were the supreme issues before the country by a speech showing that these are trifles compared with the menace of Germany . But he has also found time to send to the papers an Anti - Suffrage Manifesto , in which he serves up again the worn - out shreds of barbarous pre- judice and false sentiment which masquerade as Anti- Suffragist reasons . We propose to touch on a few of the main points of his letter .


### Column 1

CAUSE . 495 1. Women's Suffrage will lead to Adult Suffrage and women in Parliament and the Cabinet . Now , Women's Suffrage will " lead to whatever the electors choose it shall lead to , neither more nor less . Lord James of Hereford stated that to give women the municipal fran- chise would inevitably lead to giving them the Parliamen- tary franchise , yet Lord James is now found Partington- like , striving to sweep back the tide he himself declared to be inevitable . For just as long as the electors please , they can resist Adult Suffrage or any other extension ; when they no longer please to resist it , they will give it . Women do not base their claim on abstract logic , which has nothing to do with the demand for representation , but on their deep need and where a great need exists , it will make itself heard . CC 23 2. Lord Cromer denies women's need for representa- tion , and says their interests are fully guarded . Every man who possessed power has , down all the ages , thought , sometimes honestly , sometimes not , that he was able to represent and safeguard the interests of the powerless . The employers said they guarded the interests of labour ; the landlords held that they protected their tenants . Yet did the workmen and the tenants demand direct represen- tation . So do the women . They do not accuse men of deliberately subordinating the interests of women , but they find that politicians are not sensitive to the desires of the voteless , and they know enough about the " origin " of some of the laws which discriminate between the sexes , to know that it lay in the old conception of woman as the chattel of man , protected ( in so far as she is pro- tected ) as his property ; not for herself , but for him . 3. Lord Cromer draws attention to the Women's Anti - Suffrage petition , which is now stated to have been signed by 329,878 women . The largest petition for the Suffrage was a memorial presented in 1896 , and signed by over a quarter of a million . The Anti - Suffragists have , it seems , considerably passed that , and we do not wish to encourage the notion that due weight should not be given to their petition . But we must remember , first , that the enormous increase in the vitality of the Suffrage move- ment during the past four years is unrepresented by women's petitions , since Suffragists have given up petitioning by non - voters ; second , that though , no doubt , there are many intelligent and estimable women among the signatories of the Anti - Suffrage petition , the enor- mous preponderance of distinguished women , doctors , teachers , graduates , and so forth is in favour of the Suffrage ; further , we know too many instances of signa- tures obtained through misunderstanding and ignorance , and even the kind of pressure that is put by rich people inducing their servants and employees to sign for fear of consequences , to attach much value to this petition ; and , lastly , we would point out that it is always harder to get people to move than to sit still . The multiplying tenfold of members of Suffrage Societies , the enormous sums of money subscribed , the 32,000 signatures of male electors collected at only 14 by - elections by the National Union , every name verified by voting number and address , out- weigh , and ought to outweigh , the dead unreasoning resistance of the Anti - Suffragists . 4. The mental and moral aptitudes of women and men are different , and therefore they should not do the same things . But then women should not pay taxes like men , nor should they be subject to the same laws as men . What mental and moral aptitudes " are required for voting for a member of Parliament ? Mainly these : a power of judging candidates , their capacity and honesty ; an honest and unselfish love of the country and a desire to serve its best interests ; a knowledge of the interests of the class and sex to which the voter belongs . Judged by such standards , who shall say that women are not at least as fit as men to vote ? It is constantly forgotten that the act of voting is an act of delegation . The mass of the people delegates its fighting and its legislation and its administration to selected bodies of men . Â« C 5. Lord Cromer says that Women's Suffrage has nowhere been tried for long , and has been confined to " small states " where there are no complicated social questions . ' New Zealand women have had the Suffrage for sixteen years , and various portions of Australia have 39

496 THE COMMON had the vote for years ; now the whole of the Common- wealth is free , and surely one cannot call Australia and New Zealand " small states , " nor can we hold that their social questions , complicated as they are by native and other racial questions , are simpler than ours . Lord Cromer quotes the United States as showing no tendency to follow the example of the Suffrage states ; this is not true , but if it were , when did England begin to wish to imitate American politics ? Even Americans are not inclined to select their political system as an exemplar to England . 6. Lastly , Lord Cromer singles out for reprobation the resistance of many Suffragists to further legislation in the supposed interests of women and the race , until the women themselves can be consulted . In this he only shows how corrupting is the Olympian attitude of mind , which says , " I know better what is good for you than you know yourself . " Lord Cromer would , probably , admit that women know more about some things ( their own bodies and souls and the babes that they bear ) than men can ; yet he calls upon those women to be content that men should , out of the depths of their ignorance , restrict women's scope , prohibit their earning ( to pro- hibit overwork is not in their power , nor do men ever seriously attempt it ) without offering them any security and with no alternative but starvation or the workhouse . In the meanwhile men continue to ignore those causes of infant mortality and race degeneration for which men are responsible , and which are by far the greater . Lord Cromer denies that political power affects " wages and the conditions of work . " In a year which has seen the passing of the Trade Boards Act , Old Age Pensions , and the establishment of Labour Bureaux , it is superfluous to point out that , for good or ill , industrial conditions are enormously affected by legislation . Men commonly talk as if women had no existence except as wives and mothers ; they will make better wives and mothers if they are better individual citizens , but it is as individual citizens , doing the duty of citizens , that they claim the vote , and when the Anti - Suffragists say , as they do ( though this , their supreme argument , has not been used this time by Lord Cromer ) , that women do not perform all the duties of citizens , we reply , then neither do men perform all the duties of citizens . Women have their special duties to perform , as men have theirs , and they have their special aptitudes and their special knowledge , and for all these reasons they should be there in the State , the equal half of mankind , to represent full humanity . Lord Cromer offers them a shadowy " chivalry " which is , for what it is worth , only given to the rich and the well - born , sometimes to the young and pretty , never to the poor girl or woman fighting for an honest livelihood . We prefer justice . A Christmas Sermon . The Virtuous Woman . 23 Our " Anti - Suffragist " friends sometimes quote to us from the Book of Proverbs such verses as " It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house . " If these proverbs are quoted as a suggestion that the " militant " Suffragists should desist from " brawling " methods , one might also commend to their notice another verse , which better illustrates the futility of personal assault and violence as a means of converting to wisdom : " Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle , yet will not his foolishness depart from him . But the concluding passage of the book is worthy of the careful study of all mankind . It is , perhaps , the most remarkable descrip- tion in all literature of the character and conduct of " The Virtuous Woman . " The introduction ( Pr . xxxi . 10 ) , " Who can find a virtuous woman ? Her price is far above rubies , " is followed by a recital , in alternate passages , of her domestic work and her public work ( with the inter- polation of one brief , but very surprising , description of her chief characteristic ) , and the passage finishes with a quite definite instruction as to the treatment to be

First come her duties as wife , house- keeper , and cook : " The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil ; she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life . She seeketh wool and flax , and worketh willingly with her hands . She is like the merchants ' ships , she bringeth her food from afar . She riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens . " Next comes a duty not at all domestic : " She con- sidereth a field and buyeth it ; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard . " Evidently the wise man is not of opinion that the home is woman's sole sphere- she may engage in such " masculine " pursuits as trade and agriculture . Then , in verse 17 , comes the remarkable description ( to which reference has been made ) of her dominating virtue . This ideal woman is characterised - by what ? Meekness , obedience , submission , clinging dependence , self - abnegation ? No ! By none of these things which we have come to look upon as the essentially " womanly virtues , but by the virtue which we are apt to regard as most distinctively masculine - strength . " She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms . " Her possession of this masculine virtue does not appear to interfere with the comfort of her household , for the description continues : " She perceiveth that her mer- chandise is good ; her candle goeth not out by night . She layeth her hand to the spindle , and her hands hold the distaff . " Neither , apparently , does it harden her heart or interfere with her womanly sympathy towards the com- munity , for : " She stretcheth out her hand to the poor , yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy . " Returning to her domestic duties , we read : " She is not afraid for the snow , for her household , for all her house- hold , are clothed with scarlet . " ( Margin , " double garments . " ) " She maketh herself coverings of tapestry : her clothing is silk and purple . ' " Then come some more public duties : " Her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land . " " Oh ! " you say , " but that is her husband's duty , not hers ! " Well , we find a marginal reference to the fourth verse of chapter xii . , which says : A virtuous woman is a crown unto her husband . " What does that expression a crown " mean ? A crowning joy " is the man " joy which completes and makes perfect all other joys ; a crowns his achievements " when he completes and makes perfect his life - work , so we may assume that the virtuous woman is a 33 crown to her husband in the sense that she completes and makes him perfect - that she is his complement ; that the two - man and woman- together make up that perfect human nature which God made in His own Image of which Image either sex alone is only an imperfect part . Surely the inference we may draw from that cross reference is that " her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land , " because his wife helps him in his political work , and so they bring to bear upon it their whole Godlike humanity and not only its imperfect part . 79 " Evidently manufacture and trade are open to her . " She maketh fine linen and selleth it , and delivereth girdles unto the merchants . Strength and honour are her clothing , and she shall rejoice in time to come . " How often are we Englishwomen told that weakness and dependence are our " womanly portion ? but it is written , " strength and honour . " " She openeth her mouth with wisdom , and in her tongue is the law of kindness . Nothing here about the folly of listening to the voice of " incompetent woman , or the danger of allowing her womanly kindness to have any part in making or administering the law ! Nothing , either , about her public work interfering with her home duties , for " She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness . Her children arise up and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her . " Then the writer sums up : " Many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all . Favour is deceit- ful and beauty is vain : but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised . "

DECEMBER 23 , 1909 . THE COMMON The book ends with a double command as to the treat- ment of the woman : -First , Give her of the fruit of her own hands . " Are we , as a God - fearing nation , obey- ing that command ? Are we giving the virtuous woman of the fruit of her own hands ? We are giving her twopence - halfpenny a gross for making matchboxes we are giving her less than 1d . a pair for the work of her own hands in making army trousers - we are giving her , to the number of 5 millions , an average wage of 7s . 6d . per week ( with the standard of living of the 20th century to maintain ) -we are giving her , in many cases , so much less than a living wage that we are driving her , weakened by hunger and cold and want , to sell her virtue for bread ! How is the English nation going to answer for it in the day when the Lord shall judge all the nations saying , " Ye have done it unto Me " ? Are we going to stand up in that day and say , " Am I my brother's keeper ? " 3 But you may say we women cannot help these things ; we have no means of doing so ! Then , my friends , is it not time that you " girded up your loins with strength and strengthened your arms , and secured to yourselves the means of doing so ? We women are part of the British nation , and we should be as responsible for its faults of government as is the male part . Is it not time that we brought our womanly political abilities as a " crown to complete and make perfect those of man ; that we stretched out our hands to the poor and needy , helping them to help themselves by making wiser laws- wiser because framed by the united effort of that dual nature which is the image of God , and not , as now , by its fragment only . For listen to the final command of this wonderful old Book of Proverbs : " Let her works praise her in the gates . " Not in the kitchen , you will notice , not in the sick - room , not even in the nursery - the wise man knew that her works would be allowed to praise her there with- out any command of his , but " in the gates , " in the " when he sitteth place where " her husband is known , " among the elders of the land . " How is the British nation obeying that command ? Does it " let her works praise her in the gates " ? It forbids her to be represented at all " among the elders of the land " who make the laws of the community . It forbids her to act as a judge , a lawyer , or a member of a jury in administering that law , even when there are women witnesses to be examined and a woman stands in the dock ! " In her mouth is the law of kindness , " but the law of England will have none of it ! " Who can find a virtuous woman ? " Truly , to the oppressed , the poor , the fallen , the sinful of her nation , as well as to those of her own household , " her price is far above rubies . " ELLEN SPARKS . Some of the Week's Utterances . Mr. Keir Hardie . Speaking at the Drill Hall , Coventry , Mr. Keir Hardie said : There was , however , another question which was going to play a more prominent part at this election than it had hitherto done , and that was the enfranchisement of women . ( Cheers . ) He believed that this was the last election that ever would be fought in England without the women of the country taking a part in it as voters . ( Cheers . ) Mr. Lloyd - George . At the Queen's Hall the Chancellor of the Exchequer made the following reference to the House of Lords , which women can adapt to the House of Commons as at present constituted . " All I say is , if it is a jury , we challenge the panel . It is a biased jury . It is not a fair jury . It is not properly summoned , it is not properly constituted . Nonconformity has ( women have ) no free access to it . It has ( they have ) no champions there ( with the exception of Mr. Keir Hardie and Mr. Snowden ) . It has ( they have ) no hearing there . Judgment goes against it ( them ) by default . We have the right to demand justice from the highest tribunal in the land , and we mean to get it too . 73

" Now , does any sane man of any political experience suppose that the Lords really believe in the wisdom of the electorate , or that they possess any power of divining the electoral mind , so as to know whether the will of the people sanctions this measure or that , or that it is technically possible to put any single separate issue before the electorate so as to test the popular will ? They say all these things : they believe none of them . They are not believers in democracy , they do not believe it is their function to divine or to consult the popular will . They don't mean to take the verdict if it runs against them ; they merely hope to bribe some electors ( read some women " ) and frighten others and confuse some more , and if all these tricks fail , they look to some turn of the party game to save them . " Other Questions . When women advance their claim to enfranchisement and say that , by Mr. Asquith's statement in the Albert Hall , Women's Suffrage is placed definitely before the electors as one of the issues at the general election , they are apt to be met by contemptuous allusions to the smallness of their minds and the assertion that the con- stitutional issue , the Lords ' Veto , and that alone is before the country . True , some whisper that it is the Budget , too , and the Conservatives say it is Tariff Reform . But last week we had a good many other hares started The position of Nonconformists , by Mr. Lloyd - George ; war and our unpreparedness , by Lord Cromer and Mr. Blatchford ; Licensing Reform , by the Manifesto of the United Kingdom Alliance ; while , of course , the Premier's statement the week before threw in Education and Home Rule . Cheer up , women ! While he is con- sidering a few trifles like this , John Bull may well be asked the simple question , " Don't you think the women might have a say as well as you , John ? Are there no women in the Churches , free and established ? Do the women not pay for war in blood and tears and hard cash ? What is there that women do not know about intemper- ance of all sorts ? Whose children go to school and who teaches them ? Are there only men in Ireland ? " Mr. Haldane . In reply to a vote of confidence which had been carried , Mr. Haldane , speaking in the Corn Exchange , Dunbar , on Monday , 13th Dec. , said they had had no interruptions from those energetic but misguided ladies going about putting questions at the wrong time- ( laughter ) , - and therefore he felt bound to say a sentence about the question , which had not been put formally . There was no doubt this agitation had set back the feeling about the question among many of the electors , but that did not affect the justice of the case . There was great division in the country and in the Government , just as he believed there was division in the alternative Government , on this question of Women's Suffrage . He had always been in favour of Women's Suffrage , and had always voted for it , and therefore he was glad that the decision of the Government was that the question should be made an open one in the next Parliament . They could not possibly have done more , and he did not think they could have done less . If in this Parliament there was an opinion in favour of Women's Suffrage , there would be every oppor- tunity of expressing it in a way that would be effective . ( Cheers . ) Mr. Redmond : On the 15th inst . Mr. John Redmond received a deputation from the Irish Women's Franchise League . This League has no connection with any English Union , but has militant sympathies . Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington made a speech introducing the requests of her League , which were : - ( 1 ) .

None of these are cam- paigns of opposition , but all are petition campaigns . We want great petitions from the constituencies of friends and of men who might become friends . We want the electors to speak this time , and to speak clearly and unmistakably , in favour of our demand ..

CAUSE . DECEMBER 23 , 1909 . full . A good report was published in the " Freeman's Journal of December 16th . The practical outcome was that he had no power to speak for his party , but if his party chose to make Women's Suffrage a party ques- tion he would abide by the decision , and he would not throw the slightest obstacle in the way of any member of the party raising that question at a meeting of the party . He wished to be convinced that women wanted the vote , and then he would not obstruct it . Reasonable speeches such as he had just heard would convince him sooner than violence , which he deprecated .

The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies has issued the following election manifesto : - For the first time in the history of the women's suffrage movement the question before the electorate brings into prominence the strength of the claim of women to share in the benefits of representative government . The House of Lords and the Conservative party appeal to the judgment of " the people . " But " the people ' are women as well as men . The Liberal party appeal against the privilege of hereditary rank ; but every argument against the privilege of rank tells with at least equal force against the other privilege of birth , that of sex . The crisis of the hour is therefore of such a character that it cannot be discussed without raising the fundamental principles of representative government and therefore the injustice and impolicy of excluding the whole female sex from representation . From another point of view the coming general election is of the utmost moment to Women Suffragists . For the first time in the history of our movement the political campaign preceding a general election has opened with important declarations from the Prime Minister and leading members of his Government on the subject of Women's Suffrage . The Prime Minister at the great meeting of the male members of his party at the Albert Hall ( December 10 , 1909 ) , after indi- cating his own continued opposition to Women's Suffrage , said : " Nearly two years ago I declared , on behalf of the present Government , that in the event which we then contemplated , of our bringing in a Reform Bill , we should make the insertion of a suffrage amendment an open question for the House of Commons to decide . ( Cheers . ) Our friends and fellow workers of the Women's Liberal Federation- ( cheers ) have asked me to say that my declaration survives the expiring Parliament and will hold good in its successor , and that their cause , so far as the Government is concerned , shall be no worse off in the new Parliament than it would have been in the old . I have no hesitation in acceding to that request . The Government ( Cheers . ) has no dis- position or desire to burk this question ; it is clearly an issue in which the new House of Commons ought to be given an opportunity to express its views . " On the same day Sir Edward Grey , at Alnwick , reiterated his continued support of Women's Suffrage . In reply to a question he said , " If that means am I in favour of a reasonable Bill for giving votes to women , I have always supported that Bill , and I don't think it right to change my opinions because what I believe to be a small minority among Mr. women has been very violent and unreasonable . Winston Churchill a few days earlier had expressed a similar

DECEMBER 23 , 1909 . THE COMMON opinion to that of Sir Edward Grey . It would not , therefore , be in the power of our opponents after the next election to say that Women's Suffrage was not before the electorate and that the new Parliament has received no mandate on the subject . It accordingly becomes in the highest degree important to fill the new Parliament , as far as possible , with men , whether Conservative , Liberal , or Labour , who are sincere Women's Suffragists . Women's Suffrage is not , and never has been , a party question . The Prime Minister indicated in the speech just quoted that it cuts across all parties and therefore presents peculiar difficulties from the party point of view . But this is not a difficulty for those women , and there are many , who put Women's Suffrage above party . The Execu- tive Committee urge most emphatically upon all the Societies in the Union and upon all sympathisers not yet included in the Union , to work solely for the return of men , to whatever party they may belong , who are publicly pledged to remove the electoral disabilities of women , and also to resist the election by all constitutional means in their power , of the enemies of women's enfranchisement . A Women's Suffragist who in the coming election promotes the success of an anti- Suffrage candidate is betraying our cause , and we earnestly hope that none such will be found within the ranks of the National Union . M. G. FAWCETT ( President ) . BERTHA MASON ( Treasurer ) . W. S. B. McLAREN ( Chairman of Committee ) . EDITH DIMOCÐº ( Hon . Secretary ) . The Council's Resolutions . The two resolutions passed at the Council meeting were printed in our issue of Dec. 9th . We reprint them to avoid misunderstandings . They were as follows : - you in I. That the general election policy of the affiliated societies be propaganda work , except in the case of noted opponents or noted supporters , and that we resolve to help no supporter who does not satisfactorily answer the following questions , which shall be the only questions election submitted : Question 1. Will your address declare yourself to be a supporter of the enfranchisement of women , and will you do everything in your power to press its urgency upon your party leaders ? Question 2. Will you oppose the enactment of any measure for extending the franchise to men which does not include women ? II . That the Executive Committee , acting in concert with the affiliated society , if any , be authorised to carry on special campaigns in the constituencies of members of the present Cabinet and of prominent men in the Unionist and Labour parties , with a special view to securing good voters ' petitions in those constituencies . It will be seen , and it was pointed out at the Council , that Resolution I. refers to the work of the Societies , which are at liberty to do propaganda work only , except where there are noted supporters to support or noted opponents to oppose and the questions are test questions . Resolution II . , on the other hand , refers to the special work of the Executive Committee , and authorizes it to conduct special campaigns with a view to securing good voters ' petitions in certain constituencies . The resolution does not specify any other work for the Executive . GENERAL ELECTION . What We Ask and How We Ask It . OUR OBJECT . The object of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies is to obtain the Parliamentary Vote for Women on the same terms as it is or may be granted to men . That is to say , if a person has the existing qualifications , that person shall not be precluded from voting because she is a woman ; and , any further extension of the franchise to men shall also include women . seen , therefore , that though the National Union does not advocate Adult Suffrage , it cannot oppose it . It will be OUR METHODS : ( 1 ) ELECTORS . We belong to no party and support no party as such . We support the best friends to women's enfranchisement in all parties . Our method is by orderly propaganda and public discussion to put the question before the electors that they may induce members of Parliament to press it forward .

, CAUSE . 499 In every constituency we hope to have an electors ' petition , which simply asks for the removal of the sex disability , and which men of all parties can sign , and we urge electors to question their candidates for us . OUR METHODS : ( 2 ) CANDIDATES . Of the candidates we ask three questions : - ( 1 ) Will you , in your election address , declare yourself to be a supporter of the enfranchisement of women ? ( 2 ) Will you do everything in your power to press its urgency upon your party leaders ? ( 3 ) Will you oppose the enactment of any measure for extending the franchise to men which does not include women ? Candidates ' Replies . The following will , in their election addresses , declare themselves in favour of Women's Suffrage : - North - West Durham- Mr. Atherley Jones , K.C. ( Liberal ) . Jarrow Mr. Peter Curran ( Labour ) , Mr. Godfrey Palmer ( Liberal ) . Stockton - on - Tees- Alderman J. Samuel ( Liberal ) . South Manchester- Mr. A. A. Haworth ( Liberal ) states in his election address that he thinks " the time has come when , in the case of widows and spinsters , the franchise should no longer be withheld on the ground of sex alone . " East Manchester- Mr. J. E. Sutton ( Labour ) answers all three questions in the affirmative . In this constituency both Liberal and Labour are favourable . Eccles Division of Lancashire- Sir George Pollard ( Liberal ) has declared in his election address that he is in favour of Adult Suffrage with abolition of the sex disqualification . Liverpool , Walton Division- Mr. F. L. Joseph ( Liberal ) will declare himself favourable in his address . Nottingham Three Liberal candidates and one Conservative will declare themselves in favour of Women's Suffrage in their election addresses . East Cambridge Sir Charles Rose ( Labour ) has answered the questions satisfactorily . Bristol North- Rt . Hon . Augustine Birrell , M.P. ( Liberal ) , in favour . Bristol East- Rt . Hon . C. E. Hobhouse , M.P. ( Liberal ) , opposed . Mr. Frank Sheppard ( Labour ) , pledged to sex equality and Adult Suffrage , and will put this in his address . Mr. Batten ( Unionist ) , in favour , but will not put it in his address . Bristol West- Dr. Saise ( Liberal ) , in India , is understood to be in Bristol South- favour . Sir W. Howell Davis ( Liberal ) , in favour , and will put it in his election address . Mr. Horace W. Chatterton ( Unionist ) , in favour . Mr. Green ( Labour ) , Adult Suffrage , and will put it in his address . Altrincham Sir William Crossley , M.P. ( Liberal ) , will include Women's Suffrage in his address . Barnsley is particularly fortunate , since whether Mr. Joseph Walton ( Liberal ) or Mr. A. W. Owser ( Conservative ) is returned , the Suffrage will have an excellent friend . Both candidates answer whole - heartedly in favour . Buckrose Division , of Yorkshire . - Sir Luke White ( Liberal ) will put Women's Suffrage into his election address . Anglesey . Speaking at Holyhead on the 18th December , Mr. Ellis Griffiths , M.P. , said that in his view there could be no representative government unless women duly quali- fied had a voice for the election of Members of Parliament .

London Society . Special General Meetings . Two special general meetings of the London Society were aeld on Friday , December 17 , at St. James's Hall . The first meeting was called , at the requisition of forty members , to rescind the following resolution passed at the Society's annual general meeting on November 5 , that Rule III . be amended to run as follows : -The Society shall consist of the present members and associates and of all per- sons who shall sign the following pledge : - I pledge myself to adhere to lawful and constitutional methods of agitation solely , and to support financially or otherwise , only such societies as adhere to these methods . " ( A ) Annual sub- scribers of any amount not less than a shilling shall be mem- bers and entitled to vote . ( B ) Non - subscribers shall be associates . Mrs. Cecil Chapman proposed a resolution to revert to the old Rule viz .: The Society shall consist of all persons who have signified in writing their approval of its objects , or their desire to join . ( A ) Annual subscribers of any amount not less than a shilling shall be members and entitled to vote . ( B ) Non - subscribers shall be associates . To this Mrs. Fawcett proposed amendments in the name of the Executive Committee , that Rule III . should read : - The Society shall consist of the present members and associates , and of all persons who have signified in writing ( a ) their approval of its object , ( b ) their adherence solely to lawful and constitutional methods of promoting this object , and ( c ) their loyal acceptance of the election policy adopted by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies at its quarterly Council meetings . ( A ) Annual subscribers of any amount not less than a shilling shall be members and entitled to vote . ( B ) Non - subscribers shall be associates . Executive Committee shall be empowered to refuse subscrip- tions from any member or members , who , in the opinion of the Committee , shall have acted in a manner at variance with , or prejudicial to , the object or methods of the Society . Mrs. Fawcett was received with prolonged applause , many of the audience rising to their feet and waving their hand- kerchiefs . Her amendments were carried by a very large majority . The as The subsequent meeting , called by the Executive Com- mittee , proceeded to enact that Rule X. should run follows : Special general meetings of the Society may be called at any time by the Executive Committee , and shall be called by the secretary within forty - two days , on the requisition of not less than one - fifth of the number of mem- bers appearing in the last annual report . passed at the annual meeting shall be rescinded before the next annual meeting , except by a two - thirds majority of a general meeting . A special general meeting shall discuss only such matters as are mentioned in the notice calling such meeting . Fourteen days ' notice shall be given of general meetings to all members . No resolution Since the meetings of December 17 some sixty resignations have been received , but during the period since the annual meeting on November 5 , 164 new members have joined , the general growth of the Society being therefore most encourag- ing ; and certain members have opened a fund to make good such financial loss as the Society has suffered from the resig- nations recorded above . An Appeal . The Election Committee of the London Society earnestly appeal to members of the Society , who have not already done so , to send in their names to Miss Strachey , 58 , Victoria Street , as being willing to help during January in connection with the general election . Among the many ways in which help can be given are the following : - A. By obtaining signatures to the voters ' petition before , or on polling day . B. By selling " The Common Cause . " C. By placing a specially designed poster outside their house . D. By going to candidates ' meetings and getting an elector to ask , or themselves asking a question on Women's Suffrage . E. By obtaining the loan of motor - cars or carriages in January . F. By accompanying speakers in their waggonettes , and giving out leaflets . G. By making flags , caps for sandwich boys , and bags for petition forms or " Common Causes " ( patterns and material provided ) . H. By chalking pavements and otherwise advertising meet- ings indoors and out .

CAUSE . DECEMBER 23 , 1909 . Advice will gladly be given to any members uncertain how best to be of use . Bristol and West of England Society for Women's Suffrage and Women's Reform Union . Amalgamation . The annual meetings of the two societies were held at 49 , Whiteladies Road , on the 14th and 15th December . On both occasions Miss Helen Fraser gave an eloquent address on the election policy of the N.U. She appealed to the members to do their share in the final act of the great drama in bring- ing the reform of women's enfranchisement nearer . They were fighting , as every true reformer must fight , with the ultimate idea of benefiting humanity , and making the world a better place . With that great idea in mind everyone of them should be ready to help to push forward the movement , and to finish a fight which had been waged so long , and in which so much self - sacrifice and labour had been expended . At the end of each meeting a proposal was carried , that the two societies should be amalgamated for mutual strength , to prevent overlapping , and to concentrate forces on working for the Parliamentary vote . This proposal had already been submitted to the two Executive and General Committees , who cordially recom- mended it to the members . The newly constituted society will be called , N.U.W.S.S. , Bristol Branch , with which is incorporated the Women's Reform Union . The two reports gave a record of unceasing work through the year , including , amongst other activities , eight perform- ances of " Man and Woman , " open - air meetings , kitchen meetings , two great public meetings , and the opening of a shop . A Christmas tree , beautifully decorated , adorned the room , and a brisk trade was carried on at the end of the meetings . A large number of calendars and Christmas cards have been sold . Promises of money and help for the election campaign were given . Miss Fraser has given invaluable help and advice , and both she and Miss Rosa Phillips have visited the newly formed branch at Winscombe , Somerset . Miss Phillips has also done good service in collecting signatures , canvass- ing for helpers , and addressing a meeting of young students at a meeting at Mrs. R. Talbot's . Surrey , Sussex , and Hants . Organisation . Last Wednesday a deputation arranged by the Portsmouth Society waited on Mr. A. Lee , the Conservative candidate for South Hants . The deputation was to have been intro- duced by Mr. Aylward , the chairman of the Conservative Association , but an unfortunate accident prevented him from carrying out his intention . Mr. Lee makes it a rule to give no pledges , and very seldom receives deputations , so that it is not surprising that although the deputation was received , Mr. Lee refused to mention Suffrage in his address , or press its urgency on his party leaders , and as an opponent of all further extension of the franchise to men , there was no need to answer our third question . Mr. Lee declared himself to have been at one time favourably inclined , but completely out of sympathy on account of militancy , and we had to listen to a very weak exposition from a candidate we all sincerely hope will never be returned , especially as he assured us he did not particu- larly care whether " he was returned or not , " and had " only drifted into politics " . the sooner he drifts out the better for us , as , at all events , Mr. Sandy will declare for us in his address , though he will not oppose the enactment of a Bill extending the franchise to men which does not include women . Mr. Lee had spoken in Cosham the night before to a meet- ing of his supporters , and to which " electors were invited . " During his speech reference was made to this , and the audience wanted to know " why women were there " ? A very broad hint to the ladies present who had gone uninvited to a political meeting . Yorkshire Organisation The Yorkshire Societies met at York on Monday , December 13 , when it was decided to concentrate on those Parlia- mentary boroughs or divisions of the county in which there was a local Society , as each branch required the services of its owns workers , and some of the branches were newly estab- lished and inexperienced , and it seemed futile to attack fresh ground with no possibility of obtaining help . It is proposed to send up fourteen petitions from Yorkshire , Miss Fielden giving a proportionate amount of help to each in turn in order of polling , with the exception of Hull and Bradford , which do not need help , and have kindly given their share to allow longer time for other places . Miss Fielden spoke at a very interesting meeting given by Mrs. Arnold , Sheffield , on Tuesday , Mrs. Hall reading a good

Miss Woodhead , the Ridings , Harrogate , gave a drawing- room meeting at very short notice on Thursday , which was much appreciated . M. F. Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association . 48 , Dover Street , Piccadilly . The Edinburgh branch of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association has arranged to hold monthly " At Homes " during the winter . The first of these took place on Wednesday , December 15 , at the house of the hon . secretary , Mrs. Spens , 33 , Heriot Row . The president of the branch , Lady Low , gave an excellent address on the political education of women , emphasising the importance of the women of the country taking wide views and interesting them- selves in the broader political issues . Mrs. Spens read the answers she had received from Unionist candidates in response to letters asking them their views on Women's Suffrage , and requesting them to mention the matter in their election addresses . Most of the candidates have returned very favourable replies . The Right Policy for the General Election . Mr. Walter McLaren has sent a letter to our contem- porary , " Votes for Women , " which has been refused for lack of space . We have much pleasure in publishing it as an interesting contribution to the discussion from a tried friend of Women's Suffrage : - To the Editor of " Votes for Women . " Madam , I have read your article in your last number with regret . I trust you will allow me as one who has worked for Women's Suffrage for many years , and whose devotion to the cause is beyond question , to offer you my respectful opinion on the policy which ought now to be pur- sued ; in view of the actual position in which we find our- selves . I regret as much as you do that the Government has not adopted Women's Suffrage as part of its programme . I think that to deny the Suffrage is inconsistent with Liberal principles , and therefore we agree so far . But let us face the actual facts . Mr. Asquith has again renewed his pledge in the Albert Hall that Women's Suffrage shall be an open question , and can be incorporated in the Government Reform Bill by a free vote of the House of Commons , if the present Government is continued in power . Neither you nor I would question the good faith of that pledge , even though we wish it went further . Clearly , then , we know the position . If there are a sufficient number of members elected to the new Parliament sincerely pledged to vote for Women's Suffrage , and if a Liberal Government is in power to introduce a Reform Bill , it will follow that an amendment will be carried to that Bill , and women will be enfranchised . If , on the other hand , a Unionist Government comes into power , you have no reason to suppose that they will deal with the franchise either for men or women . They are as a party opposed to re - opening the question , though a few are personally in favour of Women's Suffrage . Mr. Balfour has stated some years ago , while he was Prime Minister , that when the franchise is again dealt with , women's claims must be considered . He would therefore be on our side as Leader of the Opposition , if there is a Liberal Reform Bill . But if he is Prime Minister he will not bring in any Reform Bill for men . Therefore , we have everything to gain by keeping him as Leader of the Opposition and having a Liberal Gov- ernment in power . It follows from the above that our policy should be to secure the election of as many members as possible to the House pledged to vote an amendment to a Reform Bill , and , of course , also for any Women's Suffrage Bill . For the pur- pose of this question it does not matter whether such mem- bers are Liberals or Unionists . Your policy should be to support in each constituency the candidate who is most in favour of your cause , without regard to his other political principles . In this way only can you obtain the majority necessary to carry the amendment which Mr. Asquith in effect invites us to move to his Reform Bill . I do not sug- gest that you should support the Government . You , on the other hand , have never supported the Unionists ; you merely oppose Liberal candidates . That may or may not have been good policy so far . I do not discuss it . I deal with the future , and say that a new condition has arisen for the general election , and your true policy is to elect as many friends as you can , and keep out as many opponents as possible . I am , yours truly , WALTER S. B. McLAREN . 56 , Ashley Gardens , London , Dec. 13 , 1909 .

CAUSE . 501 Men's League for Women's Suffrage . 40 , Museum Street , W.C. On Thursday , December 16th , Mr. Laurence Housman spoke at the Prince's Hall , Bournemouth , for the Men's League . Unfortunately the night was very wet , so there were not as many to listen to the brilliant and able address as we could wish ; but all who heard him cried , " I hope he will come again , " for never have the women had a more able and convincing pleader for their cause . Sussex Men's League for Women's Suffrage . Mr. Adrian Brunel writes : -The above League is making I am preparations for forming branches all over Sussex . already getting into communication with Suffragists and Suffrage Societies in twelve towns , but have been unable so far to get into communication with anyone who will help me in Lewes , East Grinstead , Horsham , and Rye . If any of your readers living in these towns are willing to help , I would be very much obliged to receive their names and addresses . I propose sending them some forms to be filled up with the names of male sympathisers in their district . This can easily be done when signatures are being collected for petitions . All necessary details will be found on the forms . I also propose sending a few cards which can be " no hung on the knockers of front doors , stating that " political canvassers need apply until women are enfran- chised . " If these are wanted in small quantities or by towns outside Sussex , they can be supplied by the Men's League , 40 , Museum Street , London , W.C. I would also like to ask your readers to use the London Men's League pamphlets as much as possible during the general election , especially the declaration by well - known men , which can be sold at a penny . The Home Office and the Florists . Dear Madam , In spite of Judge Ruegg's definite recom- mendations in his Report on the Application of the Factory Act to Florists ' Workshops , the Home Secretary has refused to allow exemptions which would permit of women continuing to carry out the most skilled and highly paid parts of the florists ' trade . Judge Ruegg was appointed by the Home Office as a Commissioner to enquire into the whole question . The Commissioner reports : - " Much stress was laid before me on the fact that it was necessary , especially in the London season , to carry out decorations at customers ' houses up to the hour of 10 p.m. It was stated by the principal florists that many London hostesses require that the flowers used in the decorations of their rooms and staircases shall be absolutely fresh , and arranged as recently as possible before the entertainments A number of letters signed by some of the best- known hostesses in London were placed before me , in which the necessity of the florists ' assistants working late in the evening during the London season is insisted upon . commence . " The employers contend that the work of arranging decorations at private houses is not arduous , and that it is enjoyed by the assistants , who take an interest in it , and often , after taking part in the making up of the decorations in the workshop , have a strong desire to go to the house for which they are ordered to arrange them on tables , etc. , and to put to them the finishing touches . " I fear there is no reasonable chance of entertainments in London beginning at any earlier hour in the evening . The tendency seems to be to begin them later . Nor do I think in these days , when floral decorations are carried to an extreme degree of luxuriousness and beauty , that hostesses will be satisfied with any decorations which have lost their beauty , even though in slight degree . " The conclusion to which I am driven , I admit reluctantly , is that these decorations will be demanded in future as here- tofore , and the master florists will be required by their cus- tomers to prepare and arrange them as late in the evening as heretofore . " The skilled assistants who do this work are generally ladies of very artistic taste , and with an experience usually acquired by an apprenticeship of training of some years ' duration . " It seems to be admitted that there is no corresponding class of Englishmen who could do this artistic work . The employers declare that if this exemption is not granted to them , they will be compelled to engage foreign workmen , who are said to be easily obtainable , and who , of course , will not be subject to any limitation of hours under the Factory and Workshops Act . " Farther on Judge Ruegg recommends with regard to this question- 5. I recommend that Order No. 806 relating to employ- ment inside and outside of florists ' workshops on the same day be rescinded , and that in its place a new Order should be made . This Order , in my opinon , should ( inter alia ) permit employment inside and outside the workshop for two hours a day , but for one hundred days in the year

502 THE COMMON only . It should be an exemption for women only and not for young persons . If the outside employment occurs after the period of employment , the permitted two hours should in every case be given back to the assistant on the morning of the day after the time has been taken , and a period of at least twelve hours should elapse between the ending of the work out of the workshop and the resumption of work either in or out of the workshop on the next day . If the outside employ- ment occurs before the period of employment , the time should be given back either at the end of the same day or the beginning of the next day . On the question of the annual whole or half holidays to be given to different workers on different days , Judge Ruegg pronounces " In my opinion no necessity exists for the recision of Order 808 " ( permitting holidays to be given on different days ) . In spite of these clear and definite recommendations , we have to - day received notice from the Home Office that both these orders have been revoked . As to the consequences of the Home Secretary's action , Judge Ruegg's opinion , officially reported to the Home Office , runs- " It is said the engagement of foreigners has already to some extent begun , but the evidence has not satisfied me that up to the present time the application of the Act to the industry has led to a result so much to be deprecated . Never- theless I think that the employers ' assertion is something more than a mere threat . I do not believe they will refuse these late orders for decoration , when offered to them . It is too much to expect or demand . If they find themselves unable to execute such orders by means of their own staff of lady assistants , without giving such assistants either the morning or the afternoon off , they will , I am satisfied in some cases resort to the employment of foreigners . " We do not doubt that in this matter the Home Secretary's hand has been forced by political pressure . No other reason is possible or conceivable for his extraordinary action . The farce has been a cruel one . Time and money has been spent , a Commissioner appointed , witnesses heard , evidence collected , and a careful inquiry made . Judge Ruegg , after weighing both sides , makes certain definite recommendations . Whereupon the Home Secretary without any explanation or excuse simply reverses his judgment . It must be remembered that threats were made that this It is decision would be over - ridden by political pressure . a small thing for politicians to throw a women's trade to the wolves when a general election is on them . The question is not of much importance to employers , as they can get men to do their work . It is the women who will lose their employment . Is not this story a sufficient answer to Lord Cromer's con- tention that political power would not improve the position of the women workers ? We who have no votes to threaten Government Departments with can yet make a small protest in the coming election in Rossendale on behalf of these poor women , victims of party politics , and we beg everyone who is interested in their fate to " come over and help us . " EVA GORE BOOTH . ESTHER ROPER . 5 , John Dalton Street , Manchester , December 18th , 1909 . Mrs. D. W. Paterson . Suffragists will receive with deep regret the news of the death of Mrs. D. W. Paterson , who passed away at Edin- burgh on the 18th of November , at the great age of 82 years . She was closely associated with the late president of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage , Mrs. Priscilla Bright McLaren , in the pioneer movement for the political enfranchisement of women , and her co - operation was so highly valued that when she resigned because of fail- ing health , the committee refused to let her name be taken During the latter part of her life many sorrows off the roll . came upon her , and she bore them all with the utmost forti- tude and Christian resignation . She is survived by her hus- band , two sons , and three daughters . Her eldest daughter is Miss Emily M. Paterson , R.S.W. , the well - known artist in water colour . The Electra of Sophocles at Aldwych Theatre . The performance of Sophocles ' Electra , given last July , was repeated on the 16th in aid of Bedford College Building and Endowment Fund . The cast was the same , all the women's parts being played by past and present students of Bedford College . The house was full , and the performance a memorable one . Miss Calkin's reading of the part of Electra seemed to bring out the necessity for Orestes ' frequent rebukes . From the very beginning she raged , and the tender lament over the supposed ashes lost much of its poignancy . On the other hand , the growing wildness of her eyes and actions in the great scene with Chrysothemis was full of horror Mr. Warre Cornish as Paidagogos spoke his long oration and his whispered warning with extraordinary naturalness , and Orestes had the right fateful , passionless demeanour . The beautiful music by Granville Bantock was beautifully intoned by the chorus , whose woven paces and waving hands were charming .

CAUSE . Sonnet . DECEMBER 23 , 1909 . To the Women of England on the General Election . ( Written at the request of Mr. E. Duval . ) Dark night on us has dropped his sable wings , And wrapped in gloom the brightness of the skies ; The sober counsels of the just and wise Are drowned in noise of empty chatterings ; To each shrill cry an answering challenge rings , And ' mid the tumult of the tongues unheard The woman's voice . What valiant loins they gird To fight the ghosts of unsubstantial things ! Go forth , ye women , to the people go , The nation's mighty heart beats true and strong ; Remember if your brothers do you wrong , They do you wrong because they do not know . Go forth ! The mountain tops are all aglow , The Dawn of Justice shall not tarry long . Reviews . Herbert Jacobs . 3d . net . Woman and Evolution . By H. and M. BERNARD . There is so much that is good and stimulating in this booklet that we are sorry to see in it two fallacious generalisa- tions , which go far to vitiate the line of argument . One is ( page 7 ) the statement : " Many generations of child mar- riages are alone enough to account for that inferiority to men with which they ( women ) are taunted . " Now , any harm that child marriage does is done to the sons as well as to the daughters of that marriage , and cannot be any ground for the alleged inferiority of women as compared with men . The other false generalisation is ( page 8 ) that " a few generations of free mental and physical development would fit them to take their full share in the more serious duties and Through tradition and the responsibilities of social life . " moulding of public opinion , " a few generations " would cer- tainly enlarge women's capacities , but in the way it is stated it is suggested not only that acquired aptitudes are capable of being transmitted , but of being transmitted to one sex only . This , all biologists know , is not the case . Keats : Poems published in 1820. Edited , with Introduction and Notes , by Margaret Robertson . ( Oxford , Clarendon Press . ) The newly published 1820 volume of Keats ' poetry is a very attractive - looking book . The notes are at the end of the volume , so that the appearance of the poems themselves , in clear type , with ample margin , is not marred by the intrusive presence of the irritating asterisk , dragging one's eye to the foot of the page . The reader who knows Keats well enough to do without the help of notes can read without distraction , while the beginner has valuable aid where he can readily find it . That The introductions to each poem are admirable , especially those to the four odes , and that to " Hyperion . " Here Miss Robertson has succeeded in putting shortly and clearly what many " Keats ' " editors have involved in a cloud of incom- prehensible witness . The introduction to the whole volume gives a brief outline of the poet's life , and if the impression strikes one as a little over - favourable , it is at least a good fault in a critic to love her subject overmuch . Miss Robert- son observes that Keats " never cared for Shelley . " he could not care - could even be churlish and ungracious- to that singularly gracious spirit , has always struck me as an unlovely trait , not to be forgiven because it was partly due to the inverted snobbishness which made Keats dislike " men of birth . " And there is , to some of us , a suggestion of unhealthiness in more than the " Fanny Brawne " letters . Perhaps the most interesting suggestion in Miss Robert- son's very suggestive criticism , is her emphasis on the influ- ence of Shakespeare on the genius of Keats . It is as she justly says , " hard to define , " and perhaps for that reason has been " forma- less emphasised by other critics . But it was very tive " and very profound . Perhaps Miss Robertson may be persuaded to develop her criticism further along these lines A. M. R. some day . " The Englishwoman , " December , 1909 . Mrs. Fawcett's article on Women's Suffrage is of peculiar interest at the present moment , and will give great satisfac- tion to those ( and they are the vast majority of all Suffra- gists ) who realise that the violent tactics of the militant societies are due to the unwise , oppressive , and violent The leader of the " Constitu- tactics of the Government . tionalists " once more puts upon record her profound regret that acts of violence should have been committed by any Suffragists , and her indignation at the oppression which is primarily responsible for them .

DECEMBER 23 , 1909 . THE COMMON Liberal women , should be read by all who propose to do a stroke of work at the general election . The article of Dom Miguel de Unamuno , continued from last month , has extraordinary interest to the student of psychology and religions ; but it would be impossible to sum- marise , or even quote , without producing conclusions so extraordinary that the general reader would refuse to believe that they can have been seriously put forth . Yet Dom Miguel is serious - desperately so , and his article in " The Englishwoman " is probably the most interesting that has appeared in any periodical of this month or quarter . Finally , we must notice the criticism of the higher educa- tion of American women offered by Mr. Russell . It is diffi- cult for an Englishwoman to judge , but surely the defects he notices are the outcome of the whole spirit of American individualism plus the usual masculine " chivalry " which ensures that a woman shall always be irresponsible because " she knows no better ; she has never been taught . Her col- lege , her school , or her training , whatever it may have been , afforded no hint of instruction on any of these elementary matters . " A. M. R. The Daily News Year Book is a compilation very generous to women's work and women's interests . There is an article on the " Progress of the Women's Suffrage Movement in 1909 " by Mrs. Swanwick , and one on " People's Suffrage " by Mrs. Nash . Modern Woman in South Africa is the title of a new paper whose brave device is " Woman's place is the world ; her sphere the highest she can attain to . " It aspires to be " the official or semi - official organ of the women's organisations It has a handsome appearance , throughout South Africa . " with a cover showing an adaptation from the Lybian Sybil . The price is 6d . monthly . 33 Another Calendar is issued by the London Society . On rough cards ( 6 by 8in . ) , with a ribbon of " the colours , " to hang on the wall , the " bugler girl " on the front , and a particularly inspiring set of mottoes within , it is one of the best we have seen . Price 3d . The French Procession . By a printer's error in the review of Mme . Duclaux's book ( " Common Cause , " December 2nd ) , the word " synthetic " was printed " sympathetic . " Our reviewer remarks that to accuse Mme . Duclaux of a want of sympathy would be a serious error in criticism . Some December Magazines . In the Nineteenth Century is an article entitled " Then and Now , " by Mrs. Frederic Harrison , admitting that before 1905 the feminist movement stood with valuable educational and legal achievement behind it , but asserting that since that date " the adventures of the militants have cooled any slight feeling there might have been in this country for Women's Suffrage . " She also declares that women , while desiring privileges , are unwilling to take up the resulting responsibilities . The whole tone of the article is bitterly anti - woman . " The National Review contains an article by Dr. Elizabeth Sloan Chesset on " Women's Work in the Factory and the Home , " laying stress on the terribly thriftless existence which she says is led by factory workers , and on the unfitness of factory girls for wifehood and motherhood . The author is strongly against married women's labour , but contends that the wife , if she stays in and attends to the home and children , should have a legal share to a reasonable proportion of her husband's earnings . It should be noted that this article has raised a storm of protest in many Northern newspapers on account of alleged exaggerations and overstatements . The Contemporary Review has a notice of Mr. Edward Jenks ' book , " Husband and Wife and the Law " ( J. M. Dent and Co. 2s . 6d . ) , which shows in great detail the exact legal liability of both the contracting parties . Cornhill contains a highly amusing dialogue entitled " Votes for Men , " by Mary Cholmondeley , couched in the form of a debate held 200 years hence by Eugenia , Prime Minister , and her husband , Henry . It here appears that men lost their votes in 2009 , after the introduction of Adult Suffrage , largely on the ground of their inability to give birth to children . The doubting Henry , who longs to join a votes - for - men demonstration which is in progress , is per- suaded to continue his presidency of the Anti - Suffrage League , and to bear constantly in mind that the birth - rate ( e.g. , presumably the hand that rocks the cradle ) now really rules the world . In the same magazine is a very useful article by Mrs. L. GounnÃ© on " Women at the Polls , " urging women to present themselves for election as Councillors , and detailing briefly the necessary steps to be taken by intending candidates . Mrs. GounnÃ© also deals in detail with the special departments of local administration in which women should be able to give particularly valuable help .

The Editor is not responsible for any statement made in the correspon- dence column . Correspondents are requested to write on one side of the paper only . A DEMOCRATIC FRANCHISE . To the Editor , " The Common Cause . " Madam , Mr. Bertrand Russell urges " Suffragists to regard the People's Suffrage Federation as a friend rather than an enemy , and as able and willing to do a work which , while in no way replacing the work of the Suffrage societies , must be performed . 22 We cheerfully do so , and look forward to " the Parliament of Man " ( with a slight preponderance of women ) and " the Federation of the World " with hope . Long before it comes the traces of our graves may be obliterated , and that the completion of Mr. Russell's task " must be performed before the Suffrage societies can hope to attain their goal " we steadfastly deny . 73 -all Mr. Russell's " Finally , it should be remembered as one of the uses of the People's Suffrage Federation , that it enlists the active support of many people who will not work for a measure that concerns women only , " reminds us that these are the people we want to get rid of - they have sunk our ships too often . " There are many people - mostly men- to whom the principle that every adult human being should have a voice in the Government is inspiring and worth much effort , whereas the principle that . . . sex alone should not disqualify leaves them cold , because they are not interested in women as such , but only in women as among the dis- possessed . " These are very disagreeable people to us , and we do not think they are humorous . " Men mostly active , political men , -do not reckon themselves " dis- possesed . They have " wife , children , and friends . " rights civil and political , the " appeal to reason appeals to them , they have had a " democratic franchise " in cities and borough for forty years , they gradually extended it until they ( men ) have universally the " hearthstone franchise , " so long the ultimate goal of Liberal claims and poor men's dreams ; they see no reason why the same democratic fran- chise should not be granted to their own wives when they become their widows , for there are few men who do not consider their wives their nearest and best representatives , and have not more faith that their wives would follow their principles and even their directions than that any other suc- cessors would , even their own sons . There is many a man who doesn't see why his wife should trouble herself about the incidence of rates and taxes while he is with her , who knows well that she will have to trouble herself with them when he is gone . We would ask who it is that adopts " the ostrich- like policy of hiding our heads in the sand whenever adult was Is it not the National Liberal suffrage is mentioned " ? Federation ? For at the Leicester meeting , February 21 , 1908 , at which the resolution : " That this meeting is of opinion that an extension of the franchise to women should be passed into law at the earliest opportunity , ' carried by a majority so large that no count was required , the following resolution was lost by a large majority : " That this committee urges the Government to deal in a thorough and comprehensive manner with the question of registration reform by introducing a Bill which will provide ( a ) for one uniform qualification , regardless of sex , marriage , and value , based on a three months ' residence ; and ( b ) for simplifying the machinery of registration . " This resolution preceded the one above which was carried . The Liberal party , knowing this decision , cannot advise women to exchange the policy of the " removal of women's disabilities , " carried at Newcastle in 1905 and re - affirmed , for a policy thus rejected at the very last division of the National Liberal Federation on the subject . We agree that " there are two things to consider , namely , the attitude of the country and the position of the political parties . " Should the Tory party come in , that party carried household suffrage , rate - paying franchise , and is believed to be willing to grant the same to women . The Liberal party has hinted upon the removal of women's disabilities , and the first step is a franchise which , though granted by the other party , was Mr. Bright's Bill , and has long been acquiesced in and extended by agreement of both parties . A franchise democratic enough for men for forty years is democratic enough for us if we could get it ; and shortening of the quali- fying period with extension of the hours of polling will cure the grievances of the working - man migratory as he is , and benefit the working - woman . We must dispute the assertion that Mr. Asquith and the very small Labour Party out- weigh the majority of the Liberal party . When " almost all Liberal M.P.'s who are in favour of the suffrage " are said to be favourable " on democratic lines , " we ask , Whoever said the present franchise was not on democratic lines ? No one has said it yet . Again , we ask : Why John Smith , in a house rented at 7s . a week , is a democratic voter , and Jane Jones , next door , at the same rent , a lady of property .

We expect to persuade several of our friends to do the same , and shall write to the local press stating that a number of Suffragists have agreed to adopt this action , so that Plymouth women , at any rate , shall have some sort of representation . Thus , if only a fair number join us , the candidates will be compelled to consider them , and we shall be able to exert some influence . If this plan could be carried out in every constituency , do you not think that it would have a great influence upon the country in general , and do much to further Women's Suffrage ?

" Madam , Permit a medical woman to protest emphatic- ally against the foul aspersion on " the wage - earning wife " and her husband contained in the statement that the former " stands at the head of a steeply inclined plane at the foot of which is a course of action on the part of the husband which involves the downfall of another woman . " Does M. B. Willison realise what she is saying ? What are her grounds for this terrible assertion ? During the last ten years I have met many married women doctors and teachers , professionally and otherwise , and I can unhesita- tingly affirm that it is not from their ranks that one recruits one's cases of premature breakdown . " They and their husbands are , to outward seeming , comrades in the fullest sense of the word , happy in their common interests , and as a rule parents of children who fail singularly as examples of " a neurotic , stunted , and enfeebled race . " .66 " Let me recommend M. B. Willison to read the letter pub- lished by Mrs. Stansfield , the married woman teacher , who was recently successful in defeating an attempt to penalise matrimony by the education authorities at Warrington . What duties does a woman assume on entering the married state that she repudiates when she continues in a congenial occupation , such as teaching , instead of relinquishing it in favour of blacking boots and carrying coal ? A man - made Education Act ( I do not quarrel with it , the baby room at a big elementary school is a pleasant sight ) takes her little ones from her and hands them to a " hired assistant . " Her husband does not get home till after 4.30 p.m. , when she has returned from school bringing her chil- dren with her . Is she not an infinitely better companion for all returning to her home as a pleasant mental change , with a body that is not worn out by physical labour which has been more efficiently done in her absence by a capable working house- keeper , than appearing as an exhausted drudge , weary in body and harassed in mind by work incompletely done , such as a woman teacher is only too likely to become if compelled to undertake all the heavy tasks necessary to keep a house in order on the small means at her disposal should she be unable to supplement them otherwise ? Again , what about the point of view of other women- domestic servants and charwomen , whom she ousts from their employment by her unskilled work ? " Wages to - day are not paid except for the maximum expenditure of force . " What exactly does M. B. Willison understand by this ? Does she believe that to follow any paid occupation all available force must be used for this pur- pose and this only , that the alternatives are exclusion from every other duty and pleasure , or the non - payment of wages ? Cabinet ministers are in receipt of quite comfortable salaries , and yet find time to play golf and entertain.- Yours , H. G. C. December 12th , 1909 . APPEAL FOR THE LONDON SOCIETY .

Miss Eleanor Rathbone kindly spoke at the meetings , and at both places it was decided to start branches of the N.U.W.S.S. , which , judging by the enthusiasm shown , should be very successful . In Llandudno a public meeting was held on December 14th , when Miss Rathbone explained the General Election policy to be pursued by the N.U.W.S.S. Miss Walton Evans , in the absence of the Hon . Secretary , Mrs. Gooddy , made an appeal for funds and helpers to work the voters ' petition , and many names were sent in and a good collection taken . A vote of thanks to Miss Rathbone was proposed by Mr. Dawson and seconded by Mr. Butterworth . LIVERPOOL . On Friday evening , December 17th , a small but enthusiastic meeting was held in the Everton division . The chair was taken by the Rev. A. C. Carter , and addresses given by Mrs. Edgerton Stewart - Brown , Miss Reddish , and Mr. Herbert Gorst . Miss Leadley Brown spoke shortly on the ways in which women and respectively can help the movement , and Miss Macadam thanked the speakers . The audience comprised an unusually large proportion of men . LIVERPOOL . men A series of divisional meetings are being held here preparatory to the General Election . A good meeting took place in the East Toxteth division on Monday , December 6th , at which Miss Ellen Robinson , P.L.G. , and Mr. Allerton spoke the latter very kindly taking the place of Mr. Robert Hield , who was unable to attend owing to ill - health . Councillor A. E. Jacob was in the chair . Another equally good meeting was in the People's Hall , Boundary Street ( Kirkdale ) , on Monday , December 13th . It was addressed by Councillor Eleanor Rathbone , the Rev. Harry Youlden , and Miss C. Leadley Brown . The chair was occupied by Miss Ellen Robinson . The following day ( December 14th ) the Walton Divisional Committee arranged a splendid meeting in the Anfield Road Schools . Alderman Meade - King acted as chairman .. Mrs. Allan Bright proposed the resolution , which was seconded by Mr. F. L. Joseph , the Liberal candidate for Walton , who is putting Women's Suffrage in his election address . Mrs. Arthur Francis ( local Chairman of the C. and U. W.F.A. ) and Mr. H. Crawford also spoke . On Friday ( December 17th ) the Everton meeting was held , with the Rev. C. A. Carter in the chair , and Mrs. E. Stewart - Brown , Miss Reddish , Miss Macadam , and Mr. Herbert Gorst speaking . The resolutions at all our meetings are being carried by enormous majorities . On Tuesday next ( December 21st ) the electors of West Toxteth will be addressed by Mrs. Allan Bright and Miss Eleanor Rathbone . At Apart from these meetings other work is steadily going on . the Congregational Church Literary Society on December 14th , Miss Miss Chubb spoke very well indeed , and there was a good debate . Macadam gave a short account of the policy of the National Society at the General Election . We have already started our work on the voters ' petition , which promises to be a great success . LONDON BECKENHAM . This Society held its annual meeting of members on December 14th , when a resolution was carried , to the effect that the branch should now become a separate society , affiliated to the National Union under the name of the " Norwood and District Women's Suffrage Society . " After the business meeting a reception was held for members and friends , and Miss Abadam and Mr. Herbert Jacobs addressed a most attentive audience . Mr. Jacobs dealt with several legal points specially affecting women , and Miss Abadam insisted strongly on the necessity and importance of a non - party spirit among all Women Suffragists .

" Our first meetings since the annual meeting were held on Monday , December 13th . In the afternoon we had a drawing - room meeting at Mrs. Sanderson's , Trinity Road , when the subject was , " Why Women Need the Vote . " In the evening a public meeting was held in the Sailors ' Institute . The subject of the address was Women's Suffrage Up to Date . " Miss A. Jackson , of Hull , was the speaker at both meetings . There was a good attendance in the evening , members taking this opportunity of handing in their subscriptions , whilst a few new ones enrolled . Miss Jackson gave two very interest- ing addresses , both of which were followed by a discussion in which Mrs. Mitchell , Mrs. Geo . Hardwick , Mrs. Sanderson , and Mrs. Over- bury joined . Miss Jackson puts great faith in the chivalry of men . Our earnest hope is that none of us may have our faith in it betrayed during this election - and after . NORTH EASTERN - NEWCASTLE . At the kind invitation of Mrs. Hervey a drawing - room meeting was held at 71 , Fern Avenue , on Monday , 13th . Miss Daisy Weddell presided and Miss Margaret Mein spoke to a very appreciative audience . Most of our time is occupied at present in preparing for the General Election ; we have taken a shop in the centre of the town , 6 , New Bridge Street , and we hope that all the local sym- pathisers will come and see us there . In addition to Suffrage litera- ture we have Christmas cards and presents for sale and also some very good calendars . AYLESBURY . A meeting was held by kind permission of Mrs. Bedford at the CafÃ© , Aylesbury , on Saturday , December 18th , when Miss Helga Gill kindly spoke and explained the policy of the National Union .

Hamilton , Esq . , J.P. , in his opening remarks , referred to the attitude of political women to the General Election , encouraging women to unite on this great question and to use all the influence in their power in advancing the cause of Women's Suffrage . Miss Cooke , of Derby , then gave a very interesting address on " How Women's Vote Will Help Men . " The improved position of woman cannot but reflect favourably on the men of the country , by making women better and more intelligent companions of men , by making them more responsible wives and mothers . Marriage too would be put on a different and nobler footing once the economic independence of women was secured . A lively discussion followed . The Hon . Secretary and the Organizer then appealed for funds and for help in personal service for the General Election , and we are happy to say that our members responded extremely well . " No representation without taxation ! " In a few days we got contributions towards our election funds to the amount of Â£ 30 . We also received special gifts for our shop , one gentleman giving a load of coal , other members contributing linoleum for the floor , cups and saucers , and other things . To all our kind friends our heartiest thanks . May they be rewarded by the vote very soon ! GLASGOW - GOUROCK . A very successful meeting was held in the Gamble Institute on Friday , December 17th , at 8 p.m. This is the first time an indoor meeting on Women's Suffrage has been held in Gourock . The small hall was quite crowded . Mrs. Jas . T. Hunter and Miss Paterson ( Glasgow ) addressed the meeting . Provost Duley occupied the chair . At the end of the meeting we got names of ladies who were to help with the voters ' petition . PORT GLASGOW . A very successful meeting of this newly started branch was held on December 16th . The chair was taken by Provost McMasters , and a most interesting address was given by Dr. Elsie Inglis . At the end of the meeting twelve new members joined . Our members in Port Glasgow are not to work for the Unionist candidate , as he is very much against women having a Parliamentary vote . SCARBOROUGH . On Friday , December 17th , we held a cake sale to raise money with which to face the General Election . Despite the fact that the rain continued persistently throughout the whole of the afternoon and evening we had a successful sale , leaving a useful balance in hand . It was opened at 3 p.m. by Miss Marjorie Corbett , who spoke delightfully and in her spontaneous manner urged those who could not do any definite work for the cause to further its aims by their contributions , and dwelt specially on the great importance of the coming election . We had a cake and sweet stall which was generously contributed to by sympathizers in the branch ; a very attractive show of toys and dolls , ingeniously dressed in Suffrage colours , which proved the most attractive item in the sale . There was a stall filled with our literature , Christmas cards and calendars being specially considered , and also a second - hand stall comprising many useful household articles , ornaments , and books . Two ladies very kindly added to the charms of afternoon tea and refreshments by singing , and as a side show we had a game competition . CHELTENHAM . one . With three events on successive days the week has been a busy The annual meeting came first , and was on Wednesday , December 15th , at 3.15 o'clock , in the Town Hall large drawing - room . Lady Isabel Margesson took the chair , and the proceedings opened with business . Mrs. Frances Swiney , as Treasurer , read her report , which showed a balance of nearly Â£ 4 . The Secretary's report followed - a record of greater activity than ever before , village meetings being a feature of the summer work . These were formally adopted . The re - election of Mrs. Swiney as President and Treasurer . of Miss Theodora Mills as Secretary , and of the Committee , wh the addition of two new names , was then carried . Lady Isabel Margesson made a delightful and spirited speech as chairman , after which Mrs. Swiney gave the President's address . Miss Alice Abadam then spoke with great humour and eloquence , appealing to party women to abandon their work for the political parties and concentrate upon their enfranchisement . Tea was served at the conclusion , and nine new members joined . There have been fair reports in the Press , but it is to be regretted that so little was made of Miss Abadam's speech , which was inspiring . Next day ( Thursday ) a deputation of four members - Mrs . Swiney , Dr. Grace Stewart - Billings , Mrs. Jackson , and the Secretary , waited on Viscount Duncannon , Conservative candidate for the borough . Mr. J. B. Ransford , of the Board of Guardians , was prevented from going as he had intended . Lord Duncannon received the deputation in private at his residence . Mrs. Swiney explained the position of the Union and the strength of the demand , Mrs. Jackson

506 THE COMMON ( Hon . Secretary local B.W.T.A. ) spoke of temperance progress in New Zealand , Dr. Stewart - Billings put the medical woman's point of view , and the Secretary touched upon the position of working women . In reply Lord Duncannon said they had quite made out their case , and he would promise to press the matter on his party leaders and to oppose the further extension of the vote to men if it excluded women , but could not put the subject in his election address . In spite of much pressure he refused to reconsider his position . On the following day ( Friday ) Mr. Richard Mathias , Liberal candidate , was interviewed at his Committee Rooms , the deputation consisting of the same persons , with the addition of Mrs. Wilkins . Mrs. Swiney urged the growth of the movement , the others spoke to similar effect as before , but more briefly , and Mrs. Wilkins , as a worker in many reforms , begged that women's hands might be set free for these . Mr. Mathias ' reply was unsatisfactory . He would promise nothing beyond support of an amendment to the Reform Bill , if both were brought in , and said he would let the deputation know later on if he would put Women's Suffrage in his address . seems likely that neither candidate will be supported by the Society . ALTRINCHAM . It Owing to the hospitality of Mrs. MacGregor we were able to hold a Mrs. most successful drawing - room meeting on December 10th . Rigby , an Anti - Suffragist , was in the chair , and Miss A. M. Royden gave us an inspiring address . After it the Anti - Suffragists began to pour forth questions and objections , and from these and the effective replies of Miss Royden we feel that all present gained much knowledge and a quickened interest in the whole subject . Our meeting on December 7th for the discussion of Professor Dicey's " Letters to a Friend on Votes for Women " was extremely interest- ing , and it seems to us that such discussions are of educative value to workers as well as " wobblers . " CUMBERLAND - PENRITH . We had a very successful " At Home " on December 15th in St. Andrew's Hall . The tea was entirely supplied by contributions in kind from members ; a charge of sixpence admission was made , and all cakes over were sold at the end ; so the financial results were satisfactory . Miss Catherine Marshall was to have been the speaker , but to our great disappointment she was prevented by illness from coming . Mrs. Frank Marshall , however , came in her place , and was a delightful substitute . Miss Hart gave an interesting address dealing with Anti - Suffrage objections . A man member - who anticipates great difficulties if Adult Suffrage were granted - raised an interesting discussion by asking a question on that point . This was followed by a short musical programme , and so ended a pleasant evening . NORTH OF ENGLAND . This Society held its annual meeting on Friday , 17th , when the report and balance - sheet were presented . It was stated that 680 new members had joined this year . In view of the dreadful set - back to our movement which the " Anti - Suffrage Review " is always chronicling it may amuse our readers to know that in the two past years our membership has increased nearly eight times , the total of the Society and its branches being now 1,740 . These are annual subscribers , and many of them do continuous hard work for the cause . Half the year was taken up with strengthening our organisation . Miss Courtney has got the office into apple - pie order and established divisional secretaries and constituency books . Miss Robertson , who was appointed organizer last May , has organized innumerable meetings and started four new branches . In connection with political associations and interviewing politicians the Society has also done work ; it has helped in the Sheffield election and run the High Peak election and it is now well on with the electors ' petitions for the General Election of 1910 . The officers and committee were re - appointed . CAMBRIDGE . The first public meeting for Women's Suffrage held at Newmarket took place on December 15th . The hall was crowded , about five hundred people being present . It was a somewhat noisy_though good - tempered audience . Among the speakers were Mrs. Heitland ( in the chair ) , Mrs. Rackham , Sir Charles Rose ( the Liberal candidate for East Cambridgeshire ) . Mrs. Verrall , wife of the Conservative candidate , was also on the platform . Some of the leading people in the town signed the petition , which will doubtless meet with a larger response on polling day . Sir Charles Rose has promised to put Women's Suffrage in his election address , and has answered the N.U. questions without hesitation . Mr. Verrall has not yet replied . The following resolution was passed : -That in view of the General Election , this meeting of electors and others calls the attention of the Parliamentary candidates for the Newmarket division of Cambridgeshire to its earnest desire that in the course of the next Parliament the Franchise be granted to women on the same terms as men . NORTH HERTS . - BARLEY . A crowded meeting was held in the Town House on December 14 . The Rector , Rev. J. Frome Wilkinson , presided . A debate upon Women's Suffrage was ably opened by Miss Gill . The opposer , Mr. Tatham ( London ) , put the case for the Anti - Suffragists very poorly , his objections being mainly of sentiment and fear . Other speakers ( in every case for the motion ) were : Mrs. E. O. Fordham and Dr. Salaman . The Anti - Suffragists had no one to voice their cause ; in spite of this the motion in favour of Women's Suffrage was lost by three to one , the majority being largely composed of boys and young men . NORTH HERTS . - STEVENAGE . but Two very pleasant meetings were held at Stevenage on December 11th and 13th . On the 11th the Misses Villiers invited members and friends to meet Miss Helga Gill at eight o'clock , and , though owing to the unavoidably short notice many were obliged reluctantly to decline , those who were present were most interested and charmed by and with Miss Gill . On the 13th a drawing - room meeting was kindly arranged by Mrs. Douglas Joy at her house , which was attended by many friends in and around Stevenage . Miss Gill gave a very clear and educative address , pointing out the evolutionary character of English constitu- tional law , and claimed for the National Union's policy complete agreement therewith . She also told how the women of Norway , of

CAUSE . DECEMBER 23 , 1909 . whom she is one , obtained their enfranchisement by their zeal and arduous effort . Great interest was evinced wherever Miss Gill spoke , and several new members were enrolled . OLTON . By the kind hospitality of Mrs. Smith a drawing - room meeting was held on Wednesday , December 15th . This meeting was arranged for the purpose of explaining the election policy of the National Union . and to secure workers to prosecute it . There was a full attendance , much interest was shown , and we are hopeful that Olton will be well to the fore , whether there should be a contest on the spot or no . A resolution protesting against the handling of the Suffrage movement by the Government was passed unanimously , and the Secretary was requested to forward a copy of it to the M.P. for our division , whose attitude appears to be one of indifference slightly tinged with politeness . We therefore have decided that ours must be one of insistence coloured through with politeness . SHROPSHIRE SHREWSBURY . A very successful " At Home " was held in the County CafÃ© on Wednesday afternoon , December 15th . Mrs. Julian Osler , of Birmingham , was the speaker , and her address was so clear and forcible that it gained us four new members besides making many already existing ones ready and eager to undertake work . Our shop is now open and we are getting many inquiries as to why we want the vote and so on . Then we are working hard with our voters ' petitions , both at the shop and through our members . It will be very difficult to cover the whole of the county , as our two branches at Church Stretton and Oswestry are quite in their infancy , and in Shrewsbury alone the work is very uphill and needs all the energies of our working " members . The Hon . Secretary will be very glad to hear of sympathisers who would undertake some kind of work in any of the Parliamentary areas more particularly in Ludlow and Newport . Address Mrs. Timpany , St. Winifrede's Gardens , Shrewsbury . THREE TOWNS . At the Plymouth Chambers , Plymouth , a successful cake and pickle sale was held . In the intervals of rapid sale of goods and music by members , two excellent speeches were made - first by Miss Laura Jenkins , to whom everyone listened with the deepest interest , because she spoke from her long experience as a worker in all forms of rescue work , of drink , and of the horrors of the so - called social evil . She expressed her conviction that because most of the good women_of England were associated with this movement it will not fail . Her appeal was very successful , and through her endeavours six new members were added to the branch . Mrs. Daymond spoke from her experience as a Poor Law Guardian , and showed how much needed was the vote to all such work . " Common Causes " and leaflets were sold . WORCESTER . By kind invitation of Mrs. Carlton Rea , a debate was held at her house , on the resolution " That , in the interests of Women's Suffrage , militant methods are to be deprecated . " Mrs. Wilson ( President of the Worcester Society within the National Union ) spoke to the resolution , saying that warfare did not produce a good understanding between opponents . The policy of the Constitutional Suffragists was to form public opinion . Mrs. Kerwood ( W.S.P.U. ) opposed , saying that constitutional methods had failed . Men could be persuaded , but not politicians . An interesting discussion followed , and the resolution was passed by 32 votes to 8. Miss Williams took the chair , and the debate was conducted throughout with admirable tact and good temper . FARNHAM . A general meeting was called that the Committee might lay before the Society the plans for election work as determined on by the National Union . A little business was done by the sale of some fancy articles , given by a member , to raise funds for the election work , and of Xmas cards and calendars from N.U. Societies . Letters were read from the Parliamentary candidates of the Guildford division . Neither answered the N.U. questions fully , and it has been resolved to support neither but to work at the electors ' petition . Mrs. Durand , our delegate to the N.U. Council , ably put forward the reasons of the N.U. for adopting this policy , and asked for volunteers to distribute leaflets and work the petition at the five polling stations which lie in our part of the division , and to help by going to adjacent Societies who shall have a different polling day . Almost all present signed the workers ' sheet , but we still want quite twenty more volunteers and offers of motor - cars to take the workers to and from some of the more distant polling stations , and of money to finance the work ; for we ought to have a temporary committee - room , and leaflets and posters all cost money , so we appeal to all our members who were not able to be present at the meeting to send offers at once to the Secretary that she may go ahead with more energy , knowing the Society is backing her . It was announced that Mrs. Fawcett has promised to come and speak for us here on February 22nd , and the Society - absentees take note was expected to work to make it a meeting worthy of the President . EDINBURGH . Miss Lamond is still working at Forfar and in Dundee . Miss Low has spent a great part of the week in engaging suitable committee - rooms in the different divisions of the town and in forming divisional committees to attend to the election work . We hear that the W.S.P.U. do not intend to work the whole of Edinburgh , but to confine themselves to those constituencies where the Liberal majority is a narrow one . All the more is it necessary for us to do propaganda work in these constituencies which are left free ; but we have engaged a committee - room in each of the four Parliamentary divisions . Miss Gordon is engaged on the same task in Leith Burghs , and we hope to hold a big meeting there later on , when Miss Abadam is here . A very successful meeting was held at Kelso on Wednesday , and the Town Hall was nearly filled with a very intelligent audience who appreciated all the points of the speeches and who passed a unanimous resolution in favour of Woman's Suffrage at the close . Lady Stormonth Darling took the chair and the speakers were Miss Low and Miss Gordon . Our Friday " At Home " was enlivened by a little sale of sweets and other miscellaneous goods which had been collected and arranged ,
