    "RawTable": "FORTHCOMING MEETINGS , endorsed with those words with time , place , and speakers legibly written , on one side the paper only , and on a sheet of paper separate from other matter . BIRMINGHAM . Mrs. Cooper's campaign makes excellent progress . She goes out every dinner hour and evening , accompanied by some of our energetic members , and holds meetings in different parts of the town . By the time that her month is over she will have been to every district and we shall then , by her advice , fix on some regular pitches to be worked as long as the warm weather lasts . This week she has spoken in the Bull Ring , at Costa Green , Saltley , Ladywood , King's Norton Lodge Road , the Horse Fair , and Bearwood . Besides converting the unconverted , she has been the means of bringing out several new outdoor speakers . Miss N. H. Wright , Miss Chinneck , Miss Asling and Mrs. Walsh have all spoken , as well as Miss Taylor and Miss Alder . \" Common Causes \" have sold well , and we have several new associate members . BIRMINGHAM - MOSELEY . A most successful drawing - room meeting was held in Moseley on June 14 by the kind invitation of Mrs. Martino and Dr. Olive Elgood . The Hon . Mrs. Bertrand Russell and Lady Isabel Margesson both spoke in a most convincing and inspiring manner , with the result that we obtained many new members and a large collection . Work in Moseley is particularly valuable as it is in Mr. Austen Chamberlain's constituency . DERBY . A very successful meeting was held in the grounds of The Friary , Derby , by kind permission of Mrs. Boden , on June 19th . The President , Mrs. Francis Smith , of Wingfield Park , received the guests , who numbered nearly 400 , and Mr. Francis Smith kindly took the chair . Miss Abadam spoke with great eloquence and persuasiveness , \" comfortable woman '\" pleading with the to remember the \" un- comfortable woman , \" on whose lot in life the vote would have so great an effect . Mr. Baillie - Weaver , of the Men's League , delighted his audience with his humour and his irony , and with something deeper too . As he spoke we realised the force of the new chivalry between man and woman - the chivalry of the future , a nobler and more fitting link than the surface respect of former days . Literature was sold , and a good collection taken up , and the Derby Branch of the N.U.W.S.S. , which has only been in existence eight months , hopes that it will have gained added impetus from the meeting . INVERNESS . Miss Lamond spoke on Friday at an At Home organised by the Inverness Society , lately started by Miss Fraser . The room was crowded , and about twenty - five new members joined . We hope that an Anti - Suffrage meeting will soon be held in Inverness , so that we can arrange a debate . EDINBURGH . Miss Lamond and those assisting her had a busy time on Monday and Tuesday arranging the new offices at 40 , Shandwick Place . Miss Houldsworth , who has already given china and \u00a3 5 towards furnishing the rooms , sent a patent carpet - sweeper , towels , dusters , trays , etc ; Mrs. Watson gave a japanned screen , Miss Mair a directory , and the Committee and others a roll - top desk . Mrs. Balgarnie gave a large table and an office chair . On Thursday , Miss Lamond , Miss Gordon and Miss Low held an open - air meeting on the sands at Portobello . They hired a boat platform , handed leaflets to passers - by , and then having collected six people at a distance of twenty yards , mounted the platform and began to speak . The meeting lasted forty - five minutes , and by the end of the first fifteen a goodly crowd stood listening at the edge of the promenade . It swelled to eighty before the meeting was over . Everyone pressed forward to receive free literature and many badges were sold . We hope to go again on Thursday . Arrangements are in progress for the rousing of the women municipal voters of Edinburgh to a sense of their responsibility as regards agitation for the Parliamentary franchise ; and we hope many of them will join the Edinburgh Suffrage Society and work with us . Meetings are being organised in Perthshire , and other parts , and we want help of every kind . If anyone who has time to give would come to our office they will be warmly welcomed , and set to work at once . BRISTOL AND WEST OF ENGLAND . In connection with the special effort week of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies three drawing - room meetings were held last week in Clifton and the neighbourhood . For all three gatherings Mrs. Rackham , a member of the Cambridge Board of Guardians , was principal speaker . At the Wednesday afternoon meeting , held by kind invitation of the Misses Sturge , Miss Talbot took the chair . Mrs. Rackham , in the course of her able and interesting address , said : It is important to emphasise the close connection between the vote and the ordinary home - life of this country . The argument of the Anti - Suffragists that the normal life of the average woman tends to lead her away from politics can be applied equally to the average man , of whom the anti - suffragists have no clear picture . Such things as sanitary housing , a wholesome food and water supply , the education , medical inspection , vaccination , etc. , of children , old- age pensions , regulations of midwives , and small holdings are as vitally interesting to women as to men , and for women to interest themselves in some larger , wider sphere than the narrow home circle is directly beneficial to the family life . Moreover , the wants , grievances , and disabilities of women in their homes are not under- stood . Isolated and unorganised , the law presses hardly upon them without their being able to raise a sufficient protest . The laws of maintenance , intestacy , divorce , and parentage of children are not equal between man and wife . As it is paid work only which seems to count in the world all the hard labour done by women in the home is taken for granted . The present unjust state of affairs is causing a feeling of bitterness to grow up in the minds of women , in some instances sufficient to cut at the roots of their patriotism . The chair at the evening meeting , held at the Misses Tanner's , was taken by Dr. Geraldine Hodgson . In the course of a witty speech , and while referring to the married woman difficulty , the speaker asked , Why should a woman be damned because of a husband ? She suggested that want of property need be no bar . The husband might be looked upon as the wife's property , his value ascertained and capitalised and a vote given to the wife if he reached the necessary valuation . At the Thursday meeting Miss Theodora Johnson kindly filled the double r\u00f4le of hostess and chairman . At the close of each meeting Miss Tanner , Hon . Secretary of the local branch , made an earnest appeal for funds . She referred to the dignified propaganda work carried out by the Society at by - elections , and challenged her hearers to deny themselves a pair of gloves and give the price to help fill the election coffers . She instanced the case of a lady who had given up the rest and comfort of taxi - cabs to be able to swell her donation , and told of some blind girl , who , having nothing else to give , gave time and trouble in making a knitted baby's jacket to be sold for the Cause . LONDON . The dance organized by Mrs. Carl Hentschel and Mis Gladys Wright , took place at the Prince's Restaurant on Tuesday the 8th inst . , and was an emphatic success . The tickets went very well , and it is expected that a substantial sum will be realized . The floor was not at any time too crowded for enjoyment , and the arrange- ments met with the entire approval of the men friends of the Suffragists , though some of them seemed surprised to find we could talk , and dress , just like other people . LONDON . On Saturday evening , June 5th , Miss Packer gave a very interest- ing address on the historical side of the question , in the St. Andrew's Institute , Westminster . Speaking of the way the vote has been granted in return for service rendered to the King , Miss Packer told how it is recorded that two women landowners of Sussex were once commanded to furnish a mounted man for the King's service in consideration of their being burgesses , or voters . The name of one of these women , who are mentioned among the \" gentlemen of Sussex , was Elizabeth Pankhurst . Mr. Laurence Housman also spoke , and suggested that one of the peeresses in her own right should be urged to take her seat in the House of Lords . There does not seem to be any ground on which she could be refused . BATH . A small meeting , the first ever held in Trowbridge in the cause of Woman's Suffrage , took place on June 17th , when Mrs. Green- Armytage , of Clifton , and the Hon . Secretary of the Bath branch were the speakers . It is hoped that the little band of new members who joined the Society after the meeting will be the nucleus of a local branch ; and a larger meeting is looked for in the autumn . In Swindon , a very large and interesting field of work is awaiting development ; and here also it is intended to start a branch society from Bath later on . NORTH OF ENGLAND . The deputation to the Manchester Liberal Federation last week has borne good fruit in a promise from their Executive to invite speakers from this Society to address the Liberal Twelve Hundred in the autumn and to take a resolution . They further promise their good offices in securing that we shall be received when a Cabinet Minister comes to the city . Other Societies . WOMEN'S REFORM UNION , BRISTOL . < < By the kind invitation of Miss Salmon a parlour meeting \" was held at Cumberland Street on Wednesday , 16th inst . Mrs. W. C. H. Cross and Mrs. Willis gave addresses on \" Why Women Want the Vote . \" Mrs. Willis spoke very clearly on the need of the vote for wage - earning women . Mrs. W. C. H. Cross gave a most impressive address on the way in which politics entered the home and showed , from her experience as a district nurse in London , how vital it is to women that they should have a share in making these social reforms for which the Union she represented was working . This Union finds that after a hard day's work , women are too tired to attend an outdoor meeting , but they are only too glad to come to a friend's house , where they can sit down and listen to \" what every woman ought to know , \" as one woman said ; therefore they are having a series of these kitchen meetings in different parts of Bristol . Eight present joined the Union and more promises were given for future meetings . Great interest and enthusiasm were shown . MEN'S LEAGUE BRISTOL BRANCH . The second of the series of open - air meetings under the auspices of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage ( Bristol Branch ) was held on Durdham Down , near the bandstand , and attracted a large and interested audience . Mr. F. W. Rogers , who opened the proceedings , said that though primarily the attainment of their object would be to the advantage of women , ultimately the whole country would benefit by having the advantage of the united experience and wisdom of both its men and women assisting in its government . Mr. Daniell , who was greeted with loud applause , claimed for women an equal capacity for administration and quite as good a faculty for organiza- tion as men possessed , and concluded by urging those present to join the league and thus assist in speedily bringing about this great just , and rational reform . The other speakers included Mr. Harris , Major Edwards , and Mr. L. Heppel . Questions were invited and a short , and a spirited discussion followed . At the conclusion of the meeting several new members were publicly enrolled . The National Liberal Federation . The 31st annual meeting is to be at Southport on 1st and 2nd . A resolution is to be submitted welcoming the prospect in the present Parliament of a Reform which shall get rid of admitted defects in the present electoral and registration law . We confidently look our many supporters to see that the greatest and most universally admitted defect shall receive due attention and be impressed upon the Prime Minister . The Magazines . In the Financial Review of Reviews is a paper by Sir McLaren on \" Labour Exchanges and Compulsory Insur- ance , \" \u00e0propos of Mr. Churchill's Labour Exchanges Bill He considers that if greater regularity of men's work brought about , there will be less necessity for the labour married women , and that therefore the price of women's work will tend to rise , because there will be less forced work on the market .
