214 THE The News of the Week . The Second Reading . COMMON Going to press , as we do , early in the week we are regretfully compelled to give only the barest figures and names in the great debate on Mr. Shackleton's Bill , and comment must be reserved to next week . Whatever the issue , of this we can be sure : women will have long memories . The Debate . It has been impossible to secure admission for a repre- sentative of " The Common Cause " in the House . We are , therefore , compelled to rely on the published reports . This week we can only give a very brief account . Next week we hope to publish an analysis of the speeches and also a description of the debate by Mr. Philip Snowden , M.P. The National Union's Policy . A public meeting has been arranged to follow as quickly as possible upon the second reading . At St. James's Hall , Great Portland Street , on Wednesday , 13th , at p.m. , Mrs. Fawcett will speak on the situation and our policy and work for the future . Miss Mason and other members of the Executive Committee will also speak . More Democratic than the Democrats . It is amusing to see certain Anti - Suffragists posing as Mr. being more democratic than the Labour party . Holford Knight , who , like Dr. Massie and Mr. Hart , did not somehow get into Parliament , writes to the " Nation " last week a confused and partisan letter , in which he seemed to imply that he and a few picked Anti - Suffra- gists were the only real exponents of democracy , " and to deny that charwomen , laundresses , and midwives were " in the generally accepted sense working Does Mr. Knight really speak English ? women . " progress and " There are rumours that certain academic Suffragists are to oppose the Bill in the House because it does not " go far enough . " This would be silly enough in a pri- vate member ; in a member of the Cabinet it would be absolute proof of dishonesty of purpose . Where three- quarters of the Labour party signed the requisition for an early day ; where the People's Suffrage Federation has adjured all those who favour Adult Suffrage to support the Bill , it is surely a work of supererogation for anyone to take up the cudgels for the Adultists . They will not thank the man who so misrepresents them . Putting His Head in a Bag . Mr. Middlemore , M.P. , has been writing to a con- stituent about our Bill , and saying : " For my part , I decline to vote for Woman Suffrage without knowing first of all what the whole women of Great Britain and Ireland really wish themselves . A vote given without this knowledge is a vote given in the dark . " We pre- sume , as Mr. Middlemore can hardly expect to know what " the whole women " think , he will refrain from voting in the dark , either for or against . We admit that his phrase " the whole women is rather cryptic , but if , as we suppose , he means women , " " how is he going to find out what " all women want ? Is he making any serious efforts to find out ? Or does he , like so many others , put his head in a bag and then say he can't see ? It is dark there . Faith and Works . " " all " " Speaking at Brighton last week , Mrs. Lloyd George is reported to have said that she did not know what her husband would do about the Bill , but he was a great believer in Women's Suffrage . " Well , we shall know on Tuesday .

CAUSE . JULY 14 , 1910.- Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane . London did not treat very kindly the barbarian hordes which stormed its urbanity last Saturday . The fountains in Trafalgar Square did their best to drown the women's voices , and the House of Commons was closed to visitors and closely guarded by police . Even the weather , which was gloriously sunny in the North , scowled upon the Suffragists in London . But there was no rain , and we had sunshine enough in our hearts . The London Society and the London Police Constable made our way smooth . The Cup Tie brings the men of the North to London ; the more frivolous sex is attracted by the desire for emancipation and responsibility ; with their forest of staves they seemed to be storming the capital . Panic . Mrs. Humphry Ward , in a long letter to the " Times " of July 11th , and a leader in the same issue , take up the ground that a married woman is unfit to vote upon questions of national interest , because in some mysterious and unexplained way her work of bearing and rearing children unfits her for forming sound opinions on the merits of candidates for Parliament ; but later on Mrs. Ward , and the faithful leader - writer after her , takes up the position that the practical knowledge which a single woman can have " of men and of things . is and must always remain inferior to that of the wives , mothers , and intimate companions of men . ' So married women may not have votes because they have babies , and un- married women may not have votes because they have not babies ! The Anti - Suffragists profess to be very much out- raged at the notion of married women being " repre- sented " by spinsters and widows ; are married women , then , more adequately represented by bachelors and widowers ? Does marriage unsex a woman ? Has not every wife been a maiden , and may she not fear to be a widow ? What means this crazy effort to set men against There are women , married women against maidens ? very many married women - Suffragists who think they ought to have the vote but who , unlike Lady Jersey , have not the least desire to play the dog - in - the - manger . They believe that to raise some women will be to raise all women , yes , and all men , too . They believe there is enough liberty to go round . " Really , with its talk of the British Empire as one of the most delicately poised organisations that the world has seen , " and all this whip- ping up of sex - antagonism , distrust , envy , and detrac- tion , the " Times " is losing its head a little . C The Anti - Suffragists and the Magistrates . Sir Alfred Lyall said in his address to Mr. Asquith on the 21st : " I do not myself know of any grievances . for the removal of which it is necessary for women to have the vote . Distinguished as he is , we think more valuable the experience and judgment of Mr. Cecil Chap- man , police - court magistrate , who writes on Monday to the " Times , " I have no hesitation in saying that the absence of the woman's point of view in the root - cause of inefficiency and injustice in the laws which I administer , and owing to natural differences , men are incapable , however well - intentioned , of supplying the deficiency . I know of no remedy except that of giving women the vote . " Mr. Plowden is another magistrate who is not apt to be mealy - mouthed when it comes to giving his opinion as to how men have guarded women's interests : compare these with Dr. Massie's peroration at the Deputation : " The roll of legislation proves that with men in Parlia- ment and in power the cause of women is absolutely safe . " Absolutely safe ! With our marriage , inheritance , bastardy , maintenance , solicitation , guardianship laws what they are ! When men can at any moment take away our means of earning an honest living , and some ( there was one - signing Francis Fremantle - in this very same issue of the " Times " ) actually advocate the compulsory return of women to complete economic sub- jection , so that they may be turned into breeding machines .

As we write , the fate of the Women Occupiers ' Bill hangs in the balance . The occasion is unprecedented . The greatest and most far - reaching reform of modern times has achieved its present position quite indepen- dently of all the vast , and often corrupt , motives which generally pull the strings of party politics . The great vested interests , being in the hands of men , have all been against the women ; the capitalist Press of the country , worked to support and push these vested interests , has been mainly against the women or contemptuously silent about them ; successful candidates for Parliament have , not unnaturally , held that an electorate which sent them in at the head of the poll was good enough for them ; party agents and the party wire - pullers have almost everywhere looked askance at woman- the dark horse ! How strange if she should win the race ! How wonderful it would be if , out of a session , surely the most barren and unsatisfactory and bewildering for many years past , were to grow that wonderful flower of light - equality of the sexes ! There would be a remarkable fitness of things if only this could be so . CC For look at the matter fairly . Our lukewarm friends constantly take refuge in that most cowardly , indolent and selfish retreat the calm and easy position indicated by the statement : It is bound to come . " Ineluctable is the choice , and therefore we will let the current drift us to the end . What is that current ? The current of other people's toil , sacrifice and understanding . The stream of other women's tears ; the cries of other women's agony ; the wind of all the sorrowful sighs sent up by the needless suffering , degradation and shame of others — not ourselves . Miss Rathbone said , in her speech to Mr. it is not the way of the Asquith the other day , that average man to feel very acutely an injustice which only affects others " ; it is , perhaps , not the way of the


### Column 1

CAUSE , 215 average woman either , though doubtless women are more sympathetic than men . In this particular case , at any rate , women are largely themselves concerned and there- fore it is natural they should take more interest than men and , in the House of Commons , composed entirely of men , representing men and responsible to men only , it is ( perhaps naturally , though not very nobly ) difficult to arouse any warmth of feeling for an injustice affecting primarily women . But now the situation has so curiously changed , beyond all prediction , that men's interests are suspended , men's quarrels are compounded ( except for the trifling Parlia- mentary game of " pot - calling - kettle - black in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir Randolph Baker indulged on Friday ) , there is no work and no likelihood of work for Members this side of the autumn , and they actually have time to attend to the women . That time cannot come again . At a later period the women's voice will be drowned by the shouting of men , concerned for their power , their money - bags , their wars and their pleasures ; women's liberty will then be weighed in the scale with men's affairs and the sword of Brennus thrown into the scale ; who can doubt that a far more arduous and distressing struggle would be the result ? As it is , our claim competes with no man's . It could be settled by mutual consent ; in peace and goodwill . If payment of this instalment of a long overdue account is refused now , and by the party that would have itself considered as the party of reform , what hope is there that women will not be driven to revolt ? " When Mr. Lloyd George was set upon giving old - age pensions , did he say : " I think all people over sixty ought to have them , and I will give to none until I have the money and the power to give to all ? " Would people have believed in his professions of philanthropy if he had postponed the measure to the " dim and speculative future " and told the old people dying of hunger that he was a great believer in old - age pensions , ' but he couldn't give them to some because that wouldn't be fair to the others ? Mr. Lloyd George fancies himself as a man of compromise and diplomacy ; how shall we think him honest if he opposes an instalment of Suffrage to women , accepted by all the Women Suffragists them- selves generously welcomed even by the married women , whom this measure largely cuts out because , forsooth , it doesn't go far enough ? If the Government had desired Adult Suffrage , they should have gone to the country on that question ; they should have educated the electors upon it and taken their voice upon it . They have not done so . Adult Suffrage has not been before the country . But Women's Suffrage has been before the country till there is not a man , woman or child that is not familiar with it . The country wants a measure of enfranchise- ment for women ; the women have accepted this instal- ment ; they will not hold that man honest who picks up the Adult Suffrage stick to beat them with and then throws it into the lumber - room again to moulder . The question of Women's Suffrage is either a party question or it is not . Mr. Lloyd George cannot have it both ways . " Heads I win , tails you lose , " is a game that can only be profitably played with those in the most fresh and young stage of greenness ; many women have got past that stage ; all non - party Suffragists have had , and more and more Liberal women are having , their eyes opened . When Mr. Lloyd George talked about Queen Elizabeth at the Albert Hall meeting eighteen months ago , he showed a remarkable lack of political intelligence . He dallied then with the past ; the mis- handling he received on that occasion seems to have driven him to take refuge in the future " Anywhere , anywhere , out of the world ! " ' But women are the prac- tical sex , and the sentimental Chancellor of the Exchequer must be brought to see that women cannot feed on air , promise - crammed , and that , as long as the Prime Minister will not make the enfranchisement of women a Government measure , so long must the women themselves treat it as a non - party measure and insist on its being given a fair chance on non - party lines . We shall hold no man an honest Suffragist who , having nothing immediate to offer , yet obstructs the passage of this measure of compromise ,

216 THE COMMON A Democratic Measure . CORRECTION . Last week under the above heading we published an article in which the following passage occurred : " An occupier is a person who uses his or her premises as a dwelling - house or as a place of business , and for the purposes of voting the clear yearly value must be not less than £ 10 . " A correspondent points out that this is not correct : the Household and £ 10 Occupa- tion qualifications are distinct things . For the first there is no limit of value . A woman who paid 1s . a week or less for a room would get the vote , if she had full control of the room . The £ 10 limit applies to business premises and land , and also to joint occupancy in dwelling - houses , but it has nothing to do with the single householder . " demo- This being so , of course the Bill is even more cratic , " in the sense that more poor women would be enfranchised by it . A Gage to the " National Review . " In the " National Review for June , sandwiched between articles dealing more or less efficiently with Imperial politics and matters of literary interest , there appeared a short paper bearing the uneuphonious title : Is the New Woman Helping Woman . " The writer , Beatrix Tracey , stands for all that is limited and retro- grade in the feminist cause . At this hour of the day one hardly expects in a Monthly of any importance to find the old parrot - cries re - echoed , domestic service described as the only womanly occupa- tion , and the attraction of man and child - bearing as the only intention of female existence . One almost expects to find " Is the New Woman Helping Woman " to be an un- acknowledged reprint from the pages of that " Eighteenth Century Magazine " so amusingly described in “ The Englishwoman , " wherein it was asserted " Females should not be admired for their literary or scientific attainments , but commended for their domestic quali- one Man , one Wife ties . " Even if the law enforced ( and these " domestic " writers do not yet advocate poly- gamy , I think ) owing to the present state of the popu- lation , the surplus could scarcely all be accommodated as servants , and for these superfluous women no one has yet ventured to recommend a lethal chamber . The habit of denouncing a system for which you have no remedy to propose , is as unfair as it is stupid . Beatrix Tracey needs reminding when she deplores the idea of women invading occupations once reserved to men , that men have returned the compliment , and the domestic service which she finds so " womanly " has never been entirely confined to the female sex . In the East , and even in Europe , housework , which she apparently asso- ciates with women only , is more often performed by men . The theory that occupations should be determined accord- ing to sex at all , is a false one , it were as sensible to determine them according to the colour of people's eyes and hair . A theory which denies all regard to individuality has no place in the modern world , where the complex machinery of progress is rendering it more and more impossible . The ideal of to - day is that work should be done by those most capable of carrying it out . origin of the older theory is part of that colossal fallacy which endows all women with talents for cooking , sewing , and nursing , and all men with the understanding , generosity , and forbearance which alone would give them the right to control the lives of others . It is a fallacy which denies individuality , and is the cause of friction all the world over . There is no monopoly of talent . The on We are further informed by the writer in " The National Review " that a disastrous state of affairs has been caused by the " New Woman Movement . " " It has led woman , whose only grave care should be for the life of the next generation , into a struggle for her own existence . " Until the State endows all women account of their sex , the struggle for existence appears to present as pressing a need to the average woman as to the average man . Few , if any , women work solely for their own pleasure and glorification , and the necessities of life are required in an equal degree by both . The

JULY 14 , 1910 . struggle for existence has placed only one profession at woman's command ; it is a profession which bears an ugly name , and no man or woman who is not prepared to recommend the adoption of that profession has the right to limit the opportunities for women's work , or the advancement of women's education . To - morrow has its roots in to - day . The care for the next generation is always with us , we need the courage to face the physio- logical and psychological facts of life ; in study lies the only hope of understanding them ; in work the only means of improving them . " Life is filthy with sentimental lying , " a modern writer has very truly told us , and the supreme cant talked about woman's sphere finds a natural supporter in Beatrix Tracey . " Woman's value is so closely associated with the home , that away from a home , or the hope of a home , she is a lost unit in the calculations of a nation's riches . It is gratifying to British subjects to learn that as Florence an obscure writer places such Nightingale , Agnes Weston , and Octavia Hill , among These are the lost units of the Empire's riches . " lost legion " of such great names , but there is surely a women , who have spent , and are spending , their celibate lives in working for that fine creed , the greatest good of the greatest number , and whose " home " is in the " A good woman hearts of the people they have served . enshrined in a home , " as this writer has it , is a fine sound- ing phrase , but the element of shrine in an over - crowded slum or disease - infected hovel is far to seek , nor do the Reports of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children , or Waif and Stray Societies inspire a " lost unit " with much idea of the universal sanctity of motherhood . " women Like most writers of her class , Beatrix Tracy does not enlighten us as to whom we are to regard as these dangerous New Women . She says that " within the memory of this generation the voice of the New Woman was first heard demanding freedom and sex equality , and the rights to share in the work and the struggles of men . That voice was already old in the days of Plato : In the administration of a state , neither a woman as a woman , nor a man as a man has any special function , but the gifts of Nature are equally diffused in both sexes . And it is the realization of those equally diffused gifts , which has throughout the ages raised rebellion against artificial restrictions . The woman may be new in every century , but the voice is old , and that which she claims as her own by right is but the echo of the demand she ALIX EGERTON . has always made . Why Women Need the Vote . XIII . The Lesson from Experience ( continued ) . 2. Benefits of the Vote . In regard to the lessons we may learn from experience we may now ask , what benefits have specially accrued to women from the vote ? Mrs. Napier ( delegate from New Zealand to the Inter- national Conference of Women Workers at Berlin in 1903 ) reports : " No revolution but a steady evolution " ; the legal standard of morality and the conditions of divorce made equal for both ses . Women enabled to obtain recompense for slander without having to prove special damage . The profession of the law thrown open A Family Maintenance Act which prevents a man willing away his property without making suitable provision for his wife and children , etc. So ardent an Anti - Suffragist as Mrs. Archibald Colquhoun , speaking in 1904 on Emigration , was forced to testify as follows : - to women . " There are many inducements to ambitious women to make the Colonies their home . In New Zealand women have the franchise , and , contrary to expectation , it has not turned their heads . The legal position of women in Canada and Australasia is distinctly better than at home . The laws as to the protection of women's property are in advance of our own there are more liberal provisions on points connected with mar- riage , the custody of children , and the rights of married women , 99

JULY 14 , 1910 . THE COMMON In the " Times " itself we read last month : -In Toronto two years ago the Woman's National Council carried on a strong campaign for pure water , and pro- bably was the determining element in carrying a by - law for filtration . The recent victory for municipal honesty in Montreal was owing partly to the good work of Montreal women . How is it possible logically to contend that such good results may be achieved by the municipal vote , and no corresponding benefit accrue from the Parliamentary ? One of the most useful things the women of South Australia have obtained is a law which enables the father of an illegitimate child to be proceeded against before the birth , and on due proof the Court orders him to arrange for a doctor , nurse , lodging , and clothing for the babe . This law is said to have effected a distinct diminution of seduction and infanticide , and to have contributed to the fact that illegitimacy in South Australia is only about cent . ( " Englishwoman's Review , " October , 1906. ) per The " Melbourne Age " recently stated : " The first Australian women to receive the franchise were also the first to conceive and adopt a practical scheme for stem- ming the appalling death - rate of babies , which is common to all civilized countries to - day . " 3 The baneful influence exercised by the Anti - Suffrage attitude on women's thought , is illustrated by an article in the " Anti - Suffrage Review " for June by this same Mrs. Archibald Colquhoun , on the legal position of mothers . Only six years ago , this lady ( presumably before she became an " Anti " ) , made the statements quoted above ; to - day she constitutes herself the whole- hearted defender of the English law as it stands , and sneers at " the great Suffragist myth that woman must get the vote in order to become the legal parent of her child . " The Bill to Extend the Parliamentary Franchise to Women Occupiers . The text of the Bill promoted by the Conciliation Committee is as follows : - Be it enacted : - 1. Every woman possessed of a household qualifica- tion , or of a ten pound occupation qualification , within the meaning of The Representation of the People Act ( 1884 ) shall be entitled to be registered as a voter , and , when registered , to vote for the county or borough in which the qualifying premises are situate . 2. For the purposes of this Act , a woman shall not be disqualified by marriage for being registered as a voter , provided that a husband and wife shall not both be qualified in respect of the same property . 3. This Act may be cited as " The Representation of the People Act , 1910. " This Bill does not give the vote to women on the same terms as men , for it does not give the vote to owners of property ( unless they also occupy the property ) nor to lodgers nor to servants nor to graduates , and it specially provides that husband and wife shall not qualify as joint occupiers . In Parliament . The Time of the House . new Last week , when the House had before it the ne Budget and the Regency Bill , the times of rising were as follows : -July 4th , 11.5 p.m .; July 5th , 8.40 p.m .; July 6th , 11.30 p.m .; July 7th , 11.10 p.m .; July 8th , 5.25 p.m. It will be seen from these hours and those given last week how hollow is the pretence that there is not time to pass the Women's Suffrage Bill . Debate on the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Franchise ( Women ) Bill . He Mr. Shackleton ( Lab . , Clitheroe ) , in moving the Second Reading , explained the provisions of the Bill . justified it on the grounds that taxation and representa- tion should go together , and that those who obeyed the laws should have a voice in making them . He laid

CAUSE . 217 emphasis on the democratic nature of the Bill , which would enfranchise an overwhelming majority of working women . Sir J. Rolleston ( U. , Hertford ) seconded the motion , speaking with admiration of the self - sacrificing effort of the women promoting the cause . Mr. Lloyd George then submitted two questions of order . If this Bill receives a second reading , will it be competent for any member of the House , either in Com- mittee or on the Report stage , to move amendments ( 1 ) to omit the proviso in Section 2 ; or ( 2 ) to extend the franchise to women whose husbands possess a household qualification ? The Speaker replied that this was in the hands of the Chairman of Committee , and he would say nothing to bind him , but that as at present advised his answer would be in the negative to both questions . 2 Mr. F. E. Smith ( U. , Liverpool ) moved the rejection , in a new rôle , as the champion of democracy against Liberals and Labour . The Bill , he said , was pro- foundly undemocratic . " Every Liberal who believed in democracy was bound to oppose it . He denied women's desire for the vote but declared that if we were convinced that every woman in England wanted a vote , he should not be influenced in the least . As to the posititon of women , he affirmed that women ( especially married women ) occupied to - day a position so preferential that no parallel could be discovered in any civilised country in the world . He lightly dismissed the economic ques- tion , and contemptuously rejected comparison with any country in which women had votes . No " first - class " country , he said , had enfranchised its women . approved the work of women in local government , but suggested that had women the Imperial vote they might send men to war against their will , or , still worse , insist on peace . He 22 Mr. J. A. Bryce ( L. , Inverness Burghs ) seconded the motion . He declared ( as indeed did nearly every opposition speaker ) that women were intellectually capable of voting . He even expressed his opinion that they would vote more intelligently than men , but feared that they indisposed to compromise . If they " descended into the arena they must sacrifice the " chivalrous indulgence " hitherto accorded to " their weakness " that their enfranchise- ment would give impetus to social reform Mr. Bryce admitted , but he prophesied that the power of the Church would be enhanced . C Mr. Haldane insisted on the magnitude of the ques- tion , and the immediately practical nature of the debate because " if this House of Commons expresses itself very strongly upon the principle , then it is reasonable that an effective opportunity should be given at some time for the House to translate its opinion into a concrete form . " He warned the House against the relegation of the Bill to a Committee which might be disastrous to the measure in another place . He described the arguments of the oppo- sition speakers as having come too late , " since women were already active in public life , and social questions of vital interest to women were continually brought forward . Whilst not liking the form of the present Bill he affirmed : " I would rather have this Bill than no Bill at all , and would certainly vote for it in all its stages rather than go without the principle . He believed that were the legal disabilities of women removed , " nature would do the rest , " and men and women respectively find their appropriate work . Whilst thinking that in many respects the enfranchisement of women would affect political life very little , he expressed his belief that there were ques- tions which would receive attention and classes that would come to the front in a way unknown before . Mr. Walter Long ( U. , Strand ) , whilst acknowledging women's intellectual capacity , did not think they suffered from the lack of a vote , and demanded much further evi- dence and inquiry before so momentous a change was made . Mr. Lyttelton ( U. , Hanover Square ) made a very noble speech , basing his support of the Bill on reason and jus- tice in opposition to his prejudices . He reminded mem- bers of the political assistance gratefully accepted from women , and of women's work in the State , which made their exclusion from elementary political functions " contrary not only to justice but to honour .

218 THE COMMON " to be Mr. Belloc ( L. , South Salford ) expressed his opinion " the educated ( directly ignoring all statistics ! ) that woman , the wealthy woman , the middle - class woman would alone benefit by this Bill . He made game of the commonest Anti - Suffrage arguments , and based his own opposition to the principle on his idea of the proper rela- tions of sexes . Moreover , were any women enfranchised , they should be the mothers and not the " dis- " and those " thousands in every large appointed women town to whom no sort of civic influence should be given . Mr. Belloc gave his opinion that the populace disliked the thing , supporting this statement by the declaration that his own opposition to it had not lost him votes , though at the General Election " in South Salford there was concentrated at its utmost the whole Suffragist power in the district of Manchester . ' The North of England [ Mr. Belloc flatters himself . Society , with its 2,000 members , did not go near South Salford at the last election , but it will at the next . ] Lord Hugh Cecil ( U. , Oxford University ) supported the Bill on the grounds that many women wanted the vote , were capable of using it , and why not ? The occupation of voting was thoroughly ladylike . He emphasized the difference of principle between this Bill and Adult Suffrage , and speaking of the fate of the Bill said that the Government would be taking a grave responsibility if , as a Government , they opposed the sending of the Bill upstairs . The Bill was further opposed by Mr. Burke ( N. , Tullamore ) , on the ground that it would enfranchise chiefly " unmarried women and girls " ; by Mr. Guinness ( U. , Bury St. Edmunds ) , and by Mr. Henry ( L. , Welling- ton ) , on the ground that it would enfranchise a certain Mr. Lyell ( L. , South Edin- number of married women . burgh ) also spoke against the Bill , which would , he imagined , enfranchise propertied women , " and Mr. S. H. Butcher ( U. , Cambridge University ) asked for a on the question . referendum of both men and women Speeches in support of the Bill were made by Sir A.

Redmond ( N. , East Clare ) , who condemned as unworthy the speculation as to the results of the enfranchisement of women - he would give them their rights whether they would support or oppose the causes he had at heart ; and by Mr. Goulding ( U. , Wor- cester ) , who affirmed that enfranchisement of women was the only means by which redress could be secured for women's grievances , instancing the different treatment , by Government , of the men and women it employed . Mr. Keir Hardie ( Lab . , Merthyr ) devoted much of his speech to statistics in proof of the democratic nature of the Bill , and finally asked whether the statement of the War Secretary that the fact that the Bill was not sent to Grand Committee would not necessarily delay its final stages , meant that the Government was going to give the necessary time for passing the Bill into law this session . The debate was continued on Tuesday , the 12th . speakers were : - For the Bill : The Mr. Balfour ( Leader of the Opposition ) , Mr. Runciman ( President of Board of Education ) , Mr. W. S. B.

The result of the division was- For the motion Against Majority for ... 320 175 145 The Bill is accordingly committed to a Committee of the whole House . For Mr. Lehmann's motion to send the Bill to a Committee of the whole House the whole of the two front benches voted solid , with the exception of Mr. Gulland and Mr. Montagu . Procedure with regard to the Bill . On Monday and Tuesday , 11th and 12th , is to be debated the Bill for the Enfranchisement of Women Occupiers , of which we give the text elsewhere . The Bill is brought forward by Mr. D. J. Shackleton , Labour Member for Clitheroe , and it has the support of more than three - quarters of the Labour party , a party which is pledged to Adult Suffrage . By excluding the owner- ship vote , the dangers of plural and faggot voting , so much dreaded by the Liberals , are avoided . On the other hand , since only about one million women would be enfranchised , the step would be a very gradual one and men would still be in an enormous majority over women ; the cautious may therefore be reassured . The Bill passed its first reading without a division on Tuesday , June 14th , being brought in under the " ten minutes ' rule . " This method of procedure provides that after the Second Reading ( on which the vote will be taken on the 12th ) the Bill automatically goes to Grand Com- mittee unless it is moved and passed that it be referred to a Committee of the whole House . Those who advocate this latter procedure must be reckoned as enemies of the Bill , for it is only in Grand Committee that we can hope for progress , unless indeed the Government will give time for a Committee of the whole House . Going to press , as we do , on Tuesday afternoon , it will be impossible to give an adequate account of the debate in this number , and the state of opinion is so extraor- dinarily fluid that forecasts vary almost from hour to hour . Politicians appear to veer with every breath of rumour , and lobby journalists spread canard after canard ; the Women Suffragists would appear , alone , to be calm and resolved and confident . At this juncture is it not a monstrous absurdity and injustice that women cannot be in the House at all , except behind the grille of the " monkey - cage , " and then only by favour and on sufferance ?

JULY 14 , 1910 . THE COMMON The Parliamentary Situation . Before these words appear in print the all - important debate and division on Mr. Shackleton's Women's Suf- frage Bill will have taken place . " To be or not to be , that is the question asked on every side . During the past week , urgent whips have been issued by both supporters and opponents begging members of Parliament to be in their place on Monday and Tuesday . It is understood that the Prime Minister and several members of the Government and Opposition Front Bench will take part in the debate , but at the moment of writing there is no certainty as to the line they will respectively take . Rumour has it that Mr. Lloyd George will speak and vote against the Bill , on the ground that it is not the Bill to settle the question , and that he will support nothing short of adult Suffrage . In view of the speech made by Mr. Lloyd George in the Albert Hall eighteen months ago , we cannot believe that there can be any foundation for such a rumour . Time will show . It is well understood that after the division on the second reading has been taken , opponents will move to keep the Bill for discussion in Committee of the whole House . This course , if successful , would mean the extinction of the Bill for the present session , and possibly for the present Parliament . If as is anticipated the second reading is carried , the real friends of Woman's Suffrage will oppose this pro- cedure , and will support the Bill being referred to a Grand Committee . Mr. W. S. B. McLaren has found important precedents in favour of allowing the Bill to be referred to a Grand Committee , and has expressed the fear that " any departure from the normal course of pro- cedure will lead to a most serious revolt on the part of women asking for the Bill . " It is impossible to believe that the Government will throw any obstacles of the kind mentioned in the way of the further passage of the Bill through the House of Commons . The Prime Minister , we believe , whatever may be his own personal views on the subject , will once again recognise that public opinion is in favour of the measure , and will yield to its pressure . Meanwhile , the National Union is on the alert , and has issued a second whip to members of Parliament urging them to oppose any proposal to refer the Bill to a Committee of the whole House , and begging their friends and supporters not to leave the House on Tuesday till after the second division has taken place . BERTHA MASON , Parliamentary Secretary . The Trafalgar Square Demonstration of last Saturday . The great National Union demonstration in Trafalgar Square on Saturday , July 9 , which was organised by the London Society , was a magnificent success . I feel , as President , I must send a few cordial words of thanks to all our societies and to all the other organisations which contributed to that success , to those who came from a long distance to join us , to those who gave up their own engagements and enjoyments to swell our ranks , but most of all to the indefatigable workers of the London Society who were responsible for the whole organisation , and in less than ten days from the date when the demonstration was first determined on , were able to produce such a very beautiful and wonderful result . Miss Strachey , aided by the gallant band of helpers she is able to summon to her assistance when the need arises , has once more shown what her organising capacity is . Miss Lowndes , though ill in bed , and not able , there- fore , to take an active part in the work of preparation , nevertheless contributed many valuable ideas . For ex- ample , the symbolic doves , emblems of peace , which headed the procession ; and the pretty forest of bright evergreen , tied with scarlet ribbons , on white wands , which made the crowd in the Square so gay and brilliant on Saturday afternoon . A man who had lived in the Square for twenty years said he had never seen a meeting there before that was so beautiful to look at . The group-

Another feature which must not be forgotten was found in the scarlet bannerettes recording the number of men in various constituencies who signed the voters ' petition at the general election of last January . To have col- lected the signatures of nearly 300,000 voters to a peti- tion in favour of Women's Suffrage on the same terms as men during the three weeks of the general election in January is an achievement which is deserving of record ; and these bannerettes attracted a good deal of interest and attention . The Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association was not officially represented , but many of The its members attended and others sent greetings . societies officially represented , in addition to those who had platforms , were : - Women's Co - operative Guild . National Union of Women Workers . Fabian Women's Group . London Graduates ' Union for Women's Suffrage . Actresses ' Franchise League . Artists ' Suffrage League . Suffrage Atelier . Younger Suffragists . When the resolution was put urging all Members of Parliament in favour of Women's Suffrage to vote for the Bill promoted by the Conciliation Committee , and to see it through all its stages in the House of Commons , a forest of hands went up , and there was no dissent . The number of men in the crowd was noticeably large , and their demeanour was most sympathetic . To all who contri- buted to the success of our demonstration I offer my heartfelt thanks . MILLICENT GARRETT FAWCETT . A Demonstration in Force . Along the south side of Trafalgar Square - while the thousands of Suffragists , men and women , stood in serried ranks within , cheering their leaders and waving their bannerets and devices ; while the resolution was being carried unanimously from six platforms and the treble note of the women's cheer went up to heaven with that little touch of wildness one still finds in any cry so alien to our sober English conventions ; while happy , confident , though tired eyes smiled to each other and stranger greeted stranger as a friend - perhaps from the farthest Hebrides a friend in the cause ; while joyful anticipa- tion could be read in every word the Suffragists uttered -along the south side of Trafalgar Square stood , droop- ing and forlorn , a tatterdemalion group of unemployable- looking men , bearing on their weary shoulders the plain- tive device , " Women do not want the vote ! " Only the pencil of a Phil May could really have done justice to the exquisite absurdity of the situation . As the gallant pro- cession of banners filed out of Spring Gardens , with noise of music and of cheering , with names of great women and devices of ancient cities , with emblems of the arts and mottos of good hope , and , last not least , the rows of red banners , white - lettered , commemorating the numbers of the great voters ' petitions , the poor sandwich- men were pressed back and meekly took the gay chaff directed at them . As the speakers turned their eyes to them and pointed out the symbolism of their forlorn and derelict condition , typical of those who remain , still clinging to the relics of an outworn social system , one could not refuse to the Anti - Suffragists the sort of pity for their intellectual and moral condition that one felt for the physical condition of this human jetsam . The tide in the affairs of men had thrown them there and gone romping on , brave and joyful , and with the tide went the young in heart , whatever their age , the strong in spirit , those who hold the future in their hands . It was a great demonstration as far as numbers went ; but numbers are not difficult to get in Trafalgar Square on a fine Saturday . We were in the Square some months ago at a demonstration got up in support of the Land Taxes , and cracked up by the " Daily News " as a truly

220 THE COMMON great demonstration ; numbers there were then , though scarcely as great as ours ; but what could escape no one was the indifference of the mass of that crowd , the ignorance of the question , and the fact that the immense majority of them were out for curiosity - loafers with nothing to do . How different was our crowd on Saturday , 9th July ! Thousands wore the colours ; hundreds held wands or bannerets or devices of sorts to distinguish them from mere spectators and , as one went about , one heard the probable fate of the Bill canvassed with a keenness and an appreciation of tactics and political trickery which showed how well the Suffragists have been put on their guard , how wide and how deep is their interest . The friendly and courteous police put the numbers at some 20,000 ; and of these the great majority were actively demonstrating . From Dundee they came , and from Inverness and Edinburgh , from Hull and Lake- land , from the factories and workshops and universities of Manchester and Liverpool and Birmingham and Bristol ; from Portsmouth and the pleasant places of Surrey , Sussex and Hants . In one week , in response to the call at the Bristol Council meeting , this great con- course had been summoned , marshalled by the excellent skill and energy of the London Society . It was a great feat , and those who know most about it know best how great it was . in no A crowd is easily gathered ; a mob is of no particular value ; this was a demonstration in force of those who really mean business . A physiognomist could have been error , who studied the good , calm , earnest , thoughtful faces of that crowd . We were out to win . We shall never let go . May the end come without further waste of time , effort and money , without the bitterness of hope deferred , and without the anger that must fall on the heads of those who trifle with uttermost need . Letters and telegrams expressing regret for unavoid- able absence and deep sympathy with the objects of the meeting were received from Lady Frances Balfour , Lady Betty Balfour , the Association of Head Mistresses , Miss Eva Macmaghten ( Truro ) , Mrs. Fabian Ware , Mrs. Spence Weiss , Mrs. Ashworth Hallett , and Lady Hunter . Platform 1 . NATIONAL UNION OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE SOCIETIES ( NELSON'S COLUMN , CENTRE ) . Chairman , Mrs. Henry Fawcett ; Mrs. Philip Snowden , Mrs. Allan Bright , Dr. Anna Shaw ( America ) , Mrs. Cooper ( Nelson ) , Miss Frances Sterling ( South of England ) , Miss Chrystal MacMillan ( Scotland ) . Mrs. Fawcett's platform , between the lions , facing the National Gallery , was the centre of attraction for the largest crowd on Saturday afternoon , and it was indeed a pity that the seven speakers could not talk through megaphones , for not half of the audience , two or three thousand strong , which assembled at that platform was near enough to hear the stirring addresses . But all could see the group of leaders and the beautiful banners which lit up the black stone . Each side of Mrs. Fawcett was a banneret , a snow - white dove bearing a green olive branch in its mouth , on a red ground . The Oxford banner was among those which formed the back- ground . Mrs. Fawcett , Mrs. Snowden ( who moved the resolution ) , and Mrs. Allan Bright ( who seconded it ) , dealt with the Bill , the facilities we had won , the democratic nature of the measure , the need for more work , more effort of every sort if it was to be carried this session . Mrs. Bright reminded the audience that liberty is greater than Parliament , Con- stitution , or King , and must prevail . Dr. Anna Shaw fol- lowed , and proved that the Suffrage is far from dead in America . Mrs. Cooper told us in clear and simple words why working women need the vote , and Miss Frances Sterling spoke of the demonstration , and what it meant , not only to those present , but to the thousands of women too far away to come , who helped with their good wishes and prayers . Also of what it meant to our opponents who had sent a hand- ful of sandwich men ( professionals ) to parade up and down among our beautiful banners with their little posters bearing the words so ridiculous in such a place at such a moment- " Women do NOT Want the Vote . " Miss Chrystal MacMillan spoke on behalf of Scotland , and at 4-15 the bugle sounded for the first time , the resolution was read , and after a second bugle call , it was put and carried with acclamation . The scene from the National Gallery at this moment was beautiful indeed , as all those carrying bannerets , small flags ,

There were some Anti - Suffrage men in the crowd , one of whom was heard angrily protesting to one of the stewards : " Madam , you pay these people to come here and wave flags and shout ! " while another innocent congratulated a member of the W.S.P.U. on her pluck in venturing to sell her paper to an Anti - Suffrage demonstration ! Both these gentlemen are wiser now . After Mrs. Cooper had spoken from Mrs. Fawcett's plat- form , she spoke again from the pedestal of an unappropriated statue , where she soon gathered a good audience of those unable to get near enough to the six platforms to hear the other speeches . Platform 2 . NATIONAL UNION OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE SOCIETIES ( NELSON'S COLUMN , WEST ) . Chairman , Councillor Margaret Ashton ; Dr. Elsie Inglis ( Scotland ) , Miss M. Robertson ( Manchester ) , Miss I. O. Ford ( Yorkshire ) , Miss E. Rathbone ( Liverpool ) , Mrs. F. T. Swan- wick ( Manchester ) . Here Miss Ashton made a warm appeal to the electors to support their members in voting for the seconding and in sending the Bill to Grand Committee . Miss Eleanor Rath- bone made fun of the physical - force argument , Miss Robert- son , Miss Ford , and Mrs. Swanwick took various aspects of the " democratic " objection , and Dr. Inglis gave some of the reasons why the nation needs the voice of its women . Platform 3 . INDUSTRIAL WOMEN ( NELSON'S COLUMN , EAST ) . Chairman , Miss Gore Booth ( Manchester and Salford Women's Trade and Labour Council ) ; Miss Reddish ( member of the Home Office Arbitration Court ) , Mrs. Sophie Bryant , LL.D. , Mrs. Aldersley ( P.L.G. , Nelson , textile worker ) , Miss Hooper , M.A. ( formerly Fellow of Bryn Mawr College , U.S.A. ) , Miss Thornett , M.D. , Mrs. Violet Grundy ( secretary Union of Patent Cop Winders , Hank and Bobbin Winders , Gassers , Doublers , and Reelers ) , Mrs. Ayres Purdie ( accountant ) , Miss Collinge ( elementary teacher , Lancashire ) , Mr. Arthur Bulley ( Women's Suffrage candidate , general election , at Rossendale ) . The platform for the industrial and professional women was largely a Lancashire meeting . There was a good show of banners , representing the Manchester and Salford Women's Trades ' Council , the Barmaids ' Political Defence League , the Union of Patent Cop Winders , the Doublers and Reelers , the Manchester Cigar Makers , the Gymnastic Teachers ' Suffrage Society , and others . The Chairman ( Miss Gore Booth ) , in her speech , assured her audience that " the Bill won't enfranchise enough women to frighten anybody , " and in answer to the " Votes for Ladies gibe , she said that 80 per cent . of the women who would get votes under the Conciliation Bill are either too poor to keep a servant or are earning their own living . Dr. Sophie Bryant said they felt they had a special claim on the manhood of England to give them the protection of the vote they had so long yearned for . She welcomed the fact that they had now stronger enemies , because she knew it meant they had also stronger friends . Miss Reddish , of Bolton ( member of the Home Office Arbitration Court ) , said the Bill fell into line with the views of the vast majority of working - men whom she had come across . Mr. Arthur Bulley , the Women's Suffrage candidate for Rossendale at the general election , was on the platform . When Mrs. Aldersley , a Nelson textile worker , after ex- plaining that she had worked for fourteen years in a mill- leaving home at 5 a.m. and toiling the round of the clock , - announced that she was proud of her member , Mr. Shackle- ton , the enormous crowd in front of the east platform cheered itself hoarse . When she could make herself heard again she cried : " But although he is the Member for Nelson , and I can say ' My Member , ' I can't say ' My Representative , ' for he doesn't represent the women ! " The cries of " Shame " that rose from the mass would have convinced even the Government of the trend of public opinion . From this platform workers of all kinds - those who have toiled with their hands and those who have done brain - work in competition with men , without any consideration being asked or given for their " womanhood " pleaded that this same " womanhood " should no longer be a bar to political representation . The tremendous appeal was nobly answered . Someone said , as we listened beneath the shade of Nelson , " A Government that withstands this cannot possibly repre- sent the people . " And we replied , " It shall not . " Platform 4 . MEN'S LEAGUE FOR WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE ( PARAPET ) . Chairman , Mr. Herbert Jacobs ( president ) ; Mr. H. G.

JULY 14 , 1910 . Platform 5 . THE COMMON THE WOMEN'S LIBERAL FEDERATION ( WEST STEPS ) . Chairman , Lady Bamford Slack ; Miss Belgarnie , Mrs. C. A. V. Conybeare , Miss Alison Garland , Lady Grove , Miss Morland , Mrs. Richardson , the Hon . Mrs. Bertrand Russell . The Liberal women did not forget that they were Liberals on Saturday . They did better , they remembered , and turned the fact to good account . They appealed to a Government which they have helped to bring into existence , pointed to the very substantial aid they have rendered the party in power , and asked for their reward . They demanded the Bill as peremptorily , and expressed themselves as tired of waiting for it as any non - party society . In truth , any dilly - dallying on the Government's part should mean the dissolution of the Women's Liberal Federation . This platform had perhaps a further advantage in the fact that the speakers are experi- enced in active political life . They have worked side by side with the men , and only stopped short at the polling booth . To the already converted they were most interesting when they dived into the experiences so gained . But they were wise in not venturing far from the hoary old reasons why women should have the vote . The physical - force argument was brought up to date by reference to the famous Johnson- Jeffries fight . Nothing very new was said , but the speakers Miss were clear , spirited , and on the whole well received . " Alison Garland was most successful in catching the fancy of the crowd , especially by her explanation of women's numerical superiority . " Darwin explained that , " she said , " it's the survival of the fittest . " To the mind of a provincial there was just one hitch in the proceedings . Miss Balgarnie , who proposed the motion , addressed her audience as ' fellow- Londoners , " and appealed to them as though , forsooth , London were the nation . By a coincidence , which after all was not so very odd , she spoke from a framework of three banners which bore the strange devices of Norwich , Hull , and Edinburgh . The coincidence was not so very odd , for quite a casual glance round the square would have shown her how national a gathering was there . Subsequent speakers , Londoners and provincials alike , recognised the larger claim of their audience . Platform 6 . " TEMPERANCE WOMEN ( EAST STEPS ) . Chairman , Miss Bertha Mason ; Mrs. Bonwick , Mrs. Ormiston Chant , Miss A. W. Lile , the Hon . Mrs. Bertrand Russell , and Miss Alison Garland , supported by the Lady Cecilia Roberts , Lady Horsley , and others ; also Mrs. Brown , representing the Women's Co - operative Guild . The 6th platform , at the remote east corner of the Square , was the one allotted to temperance women , whose banners , bearing the device of " Temperance Women Demand the vote , " augmented by more banners bearing the names of " famous women who in bygone days had spoken and suffered for great and good causes , formed a picturesque and artistic background for the speakers . Amongst the standard - bearers who carried these banners were seen Mrs. and Miss Thorne , the wife and daughter of one of the members of Parliament for Wolverhampton . Miss Bertha Mason presided over an attentive audience , chiefly composed of men , and in her opening remarks drew attention to the golden opportunity , unique in the history of the movement , for the peaceful passage of a Women's Suffrage Bill through the House of Commons this session . The resolution , calling on members of Parliament to do their utmost to pass Mr. Shackleton's Bill through all its stages in the House of Commons this year , was moved by Mrs. Ormiston Chant , who , despite a severe cold , heroically stuck to her guns , and seconded by Miss Alison Garland in a bright and rousing speech . Mrs. Bonwick , in supporting the resolution , made several good points - e.g . , when comparing the present Anti - Suffrage attitude to the opposition to previous reforms , she reminded her hearers of the hatred and contempt towards the first women cyclists , also of the agitation against the Married Women's Property Bill . " It was unheard of , unthinkable that women should possess property ! Why , women property . " ( Laughter sympathetic , not derisive . ) Miss A. W. Lile , Lady Stout of New Zealand , Miss Gertrude Southall of Birmingham , and the Lady Cecilia Roberts also supported the resolution , which was passed unanimously . were Amongst those supporting the speakers on the steps of the platform were Mrs. Boden , Lady Onslow , and Miss Cooke , of Derby ; Lady Horsley ; and last , though not least , a contin- gent of temperance workers from Manchester , headed by the spirited veteran , Mrs. James Hughes , who , despite her 77 years , came up by excursion train on Saturday morning to join in the shout of " Pass the Bill , " returning to Man- chester the same evening . Just before the resolution was put , Miss Mason read a message from Lady Henry Somerset , who was unable to be present , earnestly expressing the hope that success might crown this effort so long made to obtain the principle of Par- liamentary votes for women , the weapon which could best enable them to protect the interests of the children and the home .

CAUSE . London's Thanks . 221 Dear Madam , -I write on behalf of those in London who organized the arrangements connected with last Saturday's demonstration to express their deep sense of obligation to all whose vigorous work throughout the preceding week as well as on Saturday itself secured the success of the day . To the members of the National Union outside London in particular are due the warmest acknowledgments for their uniform good nature and consideration in what were certainly trying circumstances . Many of them , after a heavy week of work , had undertaken a long and trying journey , and it was with very great regret that the organizers found themselves , in the very short time at their disposal , unable to make arrangements for the hospitality which they would have wished to provide . Much detailed information and guidance which might have been hoped for was lacking for the same reason , but the confidence of all concerned that the best possible was being done in the circumstances made everything smooth , and the dominant note of the day one of true comradeship . Warm appreciation is felt for the truly generous response to the request for foliage to decorate the wands in Trafalgar Square . We hear from Mrs. Stanton Coit , who kindly lent her garden for the occasion , that the contributions were so numerous and on so liberal a scale , that after more than 1,300 wands had been decorated there remained sufficient foliage to send bundles to six hospitals and workhouses . The mass of greenery in the Square gave a most picturesque effect to the meeting , and it is hoped that the generous donors will accept this expression of thanks , as it has not been possible to write to each individually . It is unquestionable that the successful accomplishment of a demonstration of this importance in the time given affords a striking proof of the enthusiasm and determination of members of the National Union . - Yours , etc. , Thanks to London . P. STRACHEY . I am quite sure that I voice the widespread and unanimous feeling of the provincial Societies when I offer their warmest thanks to the London Society for making it possible to demonstrate in so dignified , beautiful , and effective a way last Saturday in London . The attitude of the crowd and of the police reflected the respect in which our largest Society is held . The kindness and courtesy of our London colleagues , and the wonderfully complete arrangements , made us all proud of our comradeship . It is good for Londoners to realise that our organization extends from Land's End to John o ' Groats , and the hospitality of the London Society made this object - lesson possible . AN OLD PROVINCIAL . Telling Friend from Foe . The following letter appeared in the daily papers on July 8th : Sir , May we , on behalf of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , be allowed space in your columns to say publicly that no Member of Parliament who wishes to be considered a friend of women's enfran- chisement can possibly vote for referring Mr. Shackle- ton's Bill to a Committee of the whole House ? If , as we anticipate , the second reading is carried by a substantial majority , the real friends of applying the representative principle to women will then vote against referring the Bill to a Committee of the whole House ; for this course means its extinction for the present session , and possibly for the present Parliament . This is now thoroughly well understood by Woman Suffragists throughout the country . Your obedient servants , MILLICENT GARRETT FAWCETT , President . BERTHA MASON , Treasurer . EDITH DIMOCK , Hon . Secretary . Parliament Chambers , Great Smith Street , Westminster , S.W. Selling the Paper . Members willing to sell " The Common Cause " and dis- tribute leaflets at the Anti - Suffrage Demonstration next Saturday are asked to come to the London Society's Office at 58 , Victoria Street , S.

The area comprises the counties of Northumberland and Durham , with twelve county divisions and ten boroughs . The societies affiliated to the National Union at present existing in this area are Barnard Castle , Durham , Darlington , Newcastle , and Sunderland , but in the Newcastle Society there are many members resident in Gateshead , Morpeth , Tynemouth , Jarrow , Hexham , Wansbeck , and Tyneside who will , it is hoped , pre- sently form distinct societies within the Federation . A pre- liminary meeting of representatives from Newcastle , Darling- ton , and Sunderland was held at the end of May , at which an outline of the constitution was drawn up , and Miss Frances Hardcastle ( formerly joint hon . secretary of the N.U.W.S.S. ) was elected hon . secretary . Since then the five societies in the area have formally joined the Federation . Organization is the great need of the district , and it is satisfactory to be able to announce that before this paragraph appears in print the N.U. organizer , Miss Gordon , will be hard at work . The first meeting of the Federation Committee will be held in one of the smaller towns in the area in the course of the summer ; it will co - opt a member of the N.U.

Let honourable Anti - Suffragists think , before it is too late , in what company they may find themselves . Men's League for Women's Suffrage . Enthusiastic Caxton Hall Meeting . Simultaneously with the meeting of the Women's Liberal Federation in the same building , the Men's League held a meeting in support of the Bill on July 7th , Mr. Herbert Jacobs in the chair . The speakers were all members of the Conciliation Committee , including the secretary , Mr. H. N. Brailsford . Considering the short notice which the meeting had had , there was a large attendance . Mr. Philip Snowden was the first to speak . He explained the Bill and its genesis , and laid strong emphasis on its reasonable character . Admitting that he was an Adult Suffragist , he said that all ideals must be achieved by gradual advance , and that the Bill was thus in itself a good Bill , because it gave the franchise first to those women who had had experience in municipal affairs . Mr. Percy Alden fol- lowed in praise of the Bill , and Mr. McLaren made the im- portant point that when the sphere of work entrusted to the Standing Committees was being delimited , Sir Henry Campbell - Bannerman refused to admit the principle that Franchise Bills should be classed with financial measures as unsuitable for discussion " upstairs . " Sir Henry's conten- Hence the Prime tion was upheld by a large majority . Minister has no excuse for insisting that the Bill shall be done to death by being committed to a committee of the whole House . Mr. McLaren further said that Mr. Asquith had been forced to surrender on the point of the date of the second reading debate , and that he must be forced to a similar surrender on the question of the further progress of the Bill . Our treasurer , Mr. H. G. Chancellor , was in fighting form . He voiced the feeling of a number of Liberal members that if the Prime Minister refuses to afford the representatives of the people the opportunity he has promised of dealing effectively with the Bill , there would be " a row in the Liberal party . " Mr. Keir Hardie followed in a similar strain , and amid storms of applause predicted the fate of the Govern- ment if they burked the Bill by the device of Parliamentary procedure . Mr. Brailsford wound up the meeting with a brilliant survey of the history and present position of the Bill , and received the tribute which he has so gloriously deserved . A resolution calling on the Government to give facilities for the passing of the Bill this session was carried amid the greatest enthusiasm . J. M. M. Women's Liberal Federation Meeting in Support of the Bill . A meeting in support of the Conciliation Bill was organized by the Women's Liberal Federation at the Caxton Hall on Thursday evening , July 7th . Mrs. Eva McLaren , who pre- sided , said in her opening address that the Prime Minister had been true to his Albert Hall pronouncement in giving an early date for the second reading of the Bill . Mr. Eugene Wason , M.P. , in moving the resolution , said that he had sup- ported all kinds of Bills for women's enfranchisement , in spite of the efforts of his Anti - Suffrage friends to dissuade him . The enemy were very active with postcards and per- suasion , but he would do his best to see the Bill through . Lady Pearson seconded . Lord Farrer , in supporting , said that as a peer he sympathised with the voteless . He believed women would help legislation not only by voting , but by seats in Parliament . The Hon . Lady Barlow quoted the Society of Friends as a successful experiment , three hundred years old , in placing women and men on an equality . She spoke with admirable power of the moral basis of the women's claim . She spoke , too , of these M.P.s who had signed the requisition to Mr. Asquith , and had privately gone to the Whips to cancel their signatures . To those traitors she said

JULY 14 , 1910 . THE COMMON " Beware . " They would find their falseness would be of no political service to them . For her part she wanted no property qualification for men or women , but she supported this Bill because it was the first great step in the right direc- tion . Mr. McCulloch , M.P. , promised that the supporters of this Bill would do their best to see it through all its stages . Sir Alfred Mond , M.P. , in an enthusiastic and witty speech , pointed out the absurdity of trying to distinguish between municipal and Parliamentary intelligence . There was not a member in the House who did not gladly welcome the help of women in politics . They encouraged women to teach men how to use a vote for which they were supposed to be unfitted themselves . Members were told by energetic opponents of Women's Suffrage on postcards that women do not want the vote ; those that don't want it needn't use it . There would never have been any expansion of the franchise without a few enthusiasts doing nearly all the work . Let the sex barrier be flung down once for all . Women would not all vote one way , nor would most of them vote Tory . They were the best kind of economist , and would care for national expenditure . Miss Wallace , of Bracebridge , said that women Liberals had done hard work for their party in the past , and often kept the work on in the constituencies when the men let it drop . They deserved justice now . This Bill was not an ideal Bill , but the sex disability must be removed , for humanity was greater than sex . Sir James Yoxall , M.P. , said the question of Women's Suffrage had reached the best position it had ever held . Women would be enfranchised within one or two or three years . They must not accept counsels of despair , but must press forward their demand ; they were on the eve of success . The franchise must come . The opposition in the House of Commons was weakening . Mr. Barton , M.P. , in an effective personal allusion , said that as a posthumous child he could not but be in favour of Women's Suffrage . Further , his experience on the Man- chester City Council taught him that no matter how hard- working he and his male colleagues were , they were never able to collect such a wealth of valuable and detailed information of matters connected with slum dwellings , overcrowding , etc. , as their distinguished woman city councillor invariably pro- duced . But women as a whole would never count for much with men until they were enfranchised . The Adult Suffragists were merely making excuses . This was a question of funda- mental justice . Let women go on lobbying , and let men who made promises keep them . Mr. Cameron Corbett , M.P. , said that women would follow the precedent set by newly enfranchised men , and would vote for those who gave them the vote . He had no fault to find with the Prime Minister : the situation was in the hands of those M.P.s who promised to vote for Women's Suffrage , and were therefore supported by women . He had defeated eleven opponents at Parliamentary elections , and he did not hesitate to say that he owed those victories to women . It was not violence , but every ounce of influence that must get the vote now . Members must not only vote for the second reading , but for the Bill to be sent to a Grand Committee . Resolu- tions and second readings were in themselves of no value at this stage . We wanted the vote itself . There was in the present Parliamentary situation nothing to prevent members keeping their pledges . Mr. Charles Roberts , M.P. , said that although the Con- ciliation Bill was not a good Bill , he remembered how Mr. Gladstone had said in 1884 that it was treason to first principles to consider how those who were to be enfranchised would vote . Even if it were a much worse Bill , the Suffragist members would support it in the House because it abolished the sex monopoly . As to the Anti - Suffrage contention that women didn't want the vote , there were more women than men enrolled in political organizations in his constituency . Violence would do harm , and place Suffragist M.P.s in a difficult position . But Suffragists must keep on pressing forward their claim . Mr. Percy Alden , M.P. , said that in the last six months the question had made more progress than in the last sixty years . This Bill was an instalment of a reform long overdue . Men would be a sight more chivalrous if they knew that women had votes . " The resolution strongly supporting the Conciliation Bill was put and carried by acclamation . It was taken to Mr. Asquith on the following day by a deputation consisting of Lady Pearson , Lady McLaren , Lady Bamford Slack , Mrs. Stewart - Brown , Mr. Broadley Reid , and Miss Florence Balgarnie . The deputation was received cordially , but the Prime Minister in no way committed himself by any further pronouncement . Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association . KENSINGTON BRANCH . This branch held a most successful drawing - room meeting on Friday , July 8th , at 16 , Palace Gardens Terrace , kindly lent by Miss Eva Mackenzie , who presided . The speakers were Lady Stout ( who gave an able and convincing account of the good effect of Women's Suffrage in New Zealand ) and the Hon . Mrs. Haberfield , who dealt with the present political situation . Questions were asked , followed by an interesting discussion , and a good collection was taken .

CAUSE . Anti - Suffrage Demonstration . A Mixed Reception . 223 The Anti - Suffragists had done their very best to " pack their meeting with people of their own way of thinking . Great difficulty was experienced by Suffragists in getting admission , but Suffragists , like anti - slavery reformers , are in all families , and run through every stratum of society , and even the severest precautions fail to keep them out . There was an animated scene outside the Queen's Hall on Monday , July 11th . A long close cordon of police was drawn up on the pavement . A crowd of Suffragists were giving " The Vote , away literature and selling " Common Causes , " and " Votes for Women . " A number of women were display- ing placards with " Women Do Want the Vote . " The hall was not well filled , and from the first it was obvious that a considerable number of Suffragists formed part . of the audience . Lord Cromer's opening speech was received with cheers and hisses and groans . Mr. Shackle- ton's name was greeted with three cheers and prolonged applause , which lasted for several minutes , during which a banneret was lowered from the upper circle with " Votes for Women " on it . When Lord Cromer announced that too much forbearance had been exercised towards women , but that now the Anti - Suffrage League was going to bestir itself and defeat the Bill , there was considerable interruption , and a man was ejected from the grand circle . Sir Edward Clarke moved the following resolution : " That this meeting protests against Parliament passing any measure which would confer votes on women without a distinct ex- pression of opinion from the nation . " It was difficult to follow Sir E. Clarke's speech , because the interruptions were so frequent . When he gave an anecdote of Bismarck , who told a Russian lady who had suffered for her political opinions and was persecuted , that she must expect harsh treatment if she interfered in politics , there were loud cries of " Mrs. Humphry Ward " and " Canvassers . " He closed his speech by saying that he would never speak , work , or vote for a man who works and speaks for Women's Suffrage . Sir Edward Clarke made valiant sallies , and cracked one or two jokes , but the whole effect of his speech was marred by interrup- tions . Sir Hugh Bell , who seconded the resolution , was not accorded a better reception . His statement was that the " sole effective sanction of society was force . " He illus- trated this by saying that the Chartists were justified in using violence , and in pulling down Hyde Park railings , but that women who made an appeal to force were in an illogical impasse . These words evoked cries of " We will quote you . " " This is incitement to violence . " Miss Violet Markham supported the resolution . At the beginning of her speech there was interruption on the plat- form , and an attempt to eject a gentleman . A better hear- ing was given to Miss Markham . The resolution was put and carried by a substantial majority , but a considerable number voted against it . Three cheers were then called for Mrs. Fawcett and Mrs. Pankhurst , and this was received with cheers and waving of handkerchiefs . Mr. Leo Maxse moved a vote of thanks , and roused con- siderable antagonism by his remark that it was only the superflous woman who was agitating for the vote . A consider- able number of the audience left before Mrs. Colquhoun rose to second the vote of thanks ; some , indeed , had left the hall at the opening of the proceedings . Mrs. Colquhoun's speech was punctuated with calls from the audience . When Lord Cromer left the chair three cheers were called for and given for Mrs. Pankhurst , and a very excited meeting came to a close . Irish Women's Suffrage and Local Government Association . At a special meeting of the committee held on July 7 strongly worded letters were adopted , to be addressed to all the Irish representatives , urging them to give all possible support to Mr. Shackleton's Bill ; also letters to a large number of the subscribers all over Ireland , asking them to address similar appeals to their town and county members , whom they might hope to influence . It was also resolved to appeal to Mr. Asquith to grant further facilities for the Bill to become law during the present year . Great Demonstration at Newcastle . The Newcastle Branch of the National Union , together Liberal Women of Newcastle and district , are organizing a with the local Women's Social and Political Union and the demonstration to take place at Town Moor , Newcastle , on Saturday , July 16. The procession will leave Scotswood Road at 5-30 , nd will pass through the centre of the town , arriving at Town Moor at six o'clock . Banners of the societies , and also the petition banners of Newcastle , Tyneside , Gateshead , Jarrow , Durham , Darlington , Sunderland , and Barnard Castle will be carried . An appeal will be sent to all districts to send contingents . There will be three bands and six plat- forms . There will be speakers from the Independent Labour Party , the Women's Freedom League , and the Conservatives , and possibly from the Men's League for Women's Suffrage .

A proposal to give the communal vote to women was de- feated in the Baden Parliament in June , but it has again been brought forward by a member of the Social Democratic Party , and after a lively discussion and hearty support from the Social Democratic and Progressive parties and some individual members it was lost , by a small majority .

Mr. Walter McLaren , M.P. , introduced the deputation , and Lady Strachey read and presented the memorial . Other members of the deputation were Miss Henry , R.D.C. , Mrs. W. N. Shaw , Mrs. Maitland ( formerly an active member of the London School Board ) , Miss Kilgour , and Miss Leigh Browne ( hon . secretary of the Society ) . The representations of the deputation were directed towards showing the need for the speedy issue of a new Within Union Boarding - out Order to provide : For the regular visitation of every Within Union boarded - out child by a woman or women . For the inclusion of a proportion of women members in every Boarding - out Committee . For the co - option , where necessary , of women members , and for the status of such members . That , in any locality where the voluntary services of a sufficient number of well - qualified women cannot be obtained , a paid woman official shall be appointed by the Guardians . And that Within Union Committees authorised by the Local Government Board may retain the power of em- ploying at their discretion a medical practitioner other than the local Medical Officer of Health . The deputation made a further representation as to the need for increasing at an early date the number of Local Government Board women inspectors of boarding - out , and as to the desirability of including among the qualifications for inspectorship knowledge and experience of the requirements of healthy children as well as of sick children , and an acquaintance with different social classes and with the various aspects of country and provincial life . Mr. Burns received the deputation sympathetically , and said that he would consider the points contained in the memorial . The Women's Co - operative Guild . The Annual Congress will be held at Oxford on the 11th , 12th , 13th , and 14th , and the programme is full of interest . The report shows a wonderful record of progressive work , and resolutions are to be submitted upon Divorce , Law Reform , the Enfranchisement of Women , the Economic Position of Married Women , School Clinics , and Child Labour and Education , besides others more particularly relating to the Co - operative movement . At a public meeting on the evening of the 12th the subject is to be , most appropriately , " The Higher Education of Working Women , " and the speakers include Fru Anker , from Norway ; Dr. Stefansson , from Iceland ; and Miss Bondfield and Mrs. Barton , of the Workers ' Educational Association . The Women's Congress . The Women's Congress resumed its sittings at the Japan- British Exhibition on Monday , July 4 . On July 4 the subject for discussion was the Technical and Domestic Training of Women and Girls . The Mar- chioness of Tullibardine was in the chair . Miss C. R. Gordon ( London County Council Domestic Economy Inspector ) dealt with domestic economy in its relation both to life and to earning a livelihood . She said the limitations of time and money must necessarily affect the curriculum of those who were being technically trained in domestic subjects , but the educative advantage of such training , apart from specialisation , was very great . In the first place it created resourcefulness , and brought science into relation with the details of life ; and , secondly , in demanding the whole atten- tion of the pupil , it caused the brain to co - operate with the hands . Mrs. Despard , speaking on " The Waste of Young Life , " contrasted the way in which civilised people use their scientific knowledge in converting weeds into beautiful plants and in domesticating wild animals , and the way in which they leave the development of human life to chance . She said , living as she did in a poor neighbourhood , she was conscious of the enormous waste of young life that went on , of the appalling ignorance of boys and girls when they left school , of their total unfitness to become good fathers and mothers . Mrs. Despard described the school clinic estab- lished by herself in her own neighbourhood , and very warmly advocated the establishment of school clinics all over the country . Mr. F. G. Mackereth dealt chiefly with the scheme about to be set on foot by the Women's Industrial Council , by which a training school for young girls of the working - classes is to be combined with a day nursery for the children of working- mothers . Miss Helen Smith ( superintendent of the Borough Polytechnic ) read a paper on trade schools , and Miss Adler ( London County Council ) spoke of the work done in evening classes for women . On Tuesday , July 5 , the subject for discussion was " Women in Horticulture . " Miss Jessie Smith dealt with the profession on general lines . She dwelt on the need of at least two years ' practical and scientific training . Mr. H. Inigo Triggs read an interesting paper on garden design . Mrs. Bryant Sowerby spoke on lady florists .

JULY 14 , 1910 . 23 THE COMMON " Women in Agriculture was discussed on Wednesday , July 6. There were papers on Bee - keeping by Miss Bertha de la Mothe , on Pony Breeding by Miss Colmady - Hamlyn , on Lady Farmers by Miss V. Courtauld , on Dairy Farming by Miss M. Brown ( Lancashire C.C. ) , on Poultry Keeping by Miss N. E. Edwards , and on Fruit Preserving by Miss Edith Bradley . On Thursday , July 7 , the subject was " Women and the Fight Against Destitution . " Miss Deane ( H.M. Inspector of Factories ) was in the chair . Mrs. Sidney Webb , the principal speaker , said that everybody was agreed that destitution must be fought against , and that it was a problem that was going to occupy us for the next fifty years ; but everybody was not agreed as to the best method of doing this . For the last ten years the community had been growing richer , the income of the income - tax - paying class had increased two hundred millions a year , and that of the working - class ten millions a year . In that time the number of destitute persons had remained the same about two millions , this number including only those who actually applied for relief . She said we , as a community , were res- ponsible for the degradation of character caused by destitu- tion as well as for the physical suffering involved . It was impossible to stop destitution by merely relieving the desti- tute person after he had become destitute . She enumerated briefly the methods suggested by the Minority Report for dealing with three of the evils at present dealt with by the Poor Law - sickness , neglected childhood , and feeble - minded- ness . Instead of waiting until all these were accompanied with conditions of destitution , it was proposed to build up an organisation for preventing them before destitution set in . Mrs. Barnes read a paper on drink as a cause of destitu- tion , and remarked that every practical worker knew it was more correct to speak of destitution as a cause of drink . She said no one could deal with the drink problem at all if the moral factor were neglected , and they must therefore insist that in no human life shall there be any material impediments to moral growth . Miss Murby dealt with unemployment as a cause of destitu- tion , and pointed out certain lines on which , under the Minority Report , it could be approached and ameliorated . Mrs. C. J. Hamilton spoke on behalf of the Majority Report , basing her defence of the Poor Law system mainly on the danger of increasing the burden of taxation for the class immediately above those who were being relieved . In answering a question , Mrs. Webb pointed out that although the recommendations of the Minority Report would cause more immediate expenditure of money , this would be spent in prevention rather than in relief , and therefore would mean far less expenditure than at present when a few years had gone by . On Friday , July 8th , the subject for discussion was " Women in Philanthropy . " Lady Bell was in the chair . Lady Henry Somerset spoke on temperance . She said she was afraid that while open drunkenness was far more rare than it used to be , secret drinking was on the increase . She contended that women drank because their conditions made them hopeless , and said that when life was a dreary round of toil , one way to stop a woman from drinking was to put more amusement into her life . Mrs. Humphry Ward spoke on play centres , which she was the first to start in London five years ago . These play centres were provided to prevent children being obliged to play in the street . The first year seven of these centres were formed , with a weekly attendance of 5,000 . Last year there were thirteen centres , with a weekly attendance of 30,000 during November . Mrs. John Acland read a paper on prison work among women . She spoke enthusiastically of the good the Borstal system had done for young offenders . She paid a warm tribute to the Church Army for its help in finding work for ex - prisoners . Medical Training for Women in Scotland . The negotiations and disputes in connection with the Muirhead Trust in Glasgow have lasted so long and been the subject of so much misunderstanding , that we have obtained an account of the state of affairs from one who is thoroughly versed in all the details , and we feel sure that it will interest those who follow the steady develop- ment of the movement for the training of women . Dr. Henry Muirhead's Trust and Medical Education for Women in Glasgow . The recent Provisional Order promoted by the Uni- versity Court , the managers of the Royal Infirmary , the governors of St. Mungo's College , and the Muirhead Trustees , will result in the establishment of four pro- fessorships in the Faculty of Medicine ( of which two were previously located at the Western Infirmary ) at the Royal Infirmary . These will be the University professorships , and will provide all the classes required for the last two

CAUSE . 225 years of the five years ' course for students of medicine . The classes will be open to women and men equally , and women will be eligible to the professorships . The pro- moters of the scheme have aimed at securing for women medical students advantages which they have not hitherto possessed in Glasgow , and which may lead to a notable development of women's medical education in Glasgow . So far as the Muirhead Trustees are concerned , the scheme which has been adopted is the last of several schemes for which they have worked during the last nineteen years , and is the only one which under the present circumstances they judged to be practicable and likely to carry out the main object of Dr. Muirhead's will - viz . , to secure for women the means of good solid education in physical and biological science , such as would enable them to become medical practitioners , dentists , electricians , chemists , etc. The first scheme proposed by the Trustees was the erection of a memorial school in proximity to the Vic- toria Infirmary , and , to avoid overlapping , it was suggested that the curriculum should be divided into two parts the earlier years of study to be provided for by the then recently established medical school for women at Queen Margaret College , while the latter part of the course in medicine was to be entrusted to a Muirhead College with cliniques in the Victoria Infirmary . This proposal was rejected by the Queen Margaret College , and the Muirhead Trustees then decided to establish a com- plete medical school in connection with the Victoria Infirmary . They obtained powers to acquire Rawcliffe House , to be used partly as a residential hall and partly for classrooms , but several formidable obstacles arose . Some of the neighbouring people had a legal right to object to Rawcliffe House being used in the manner pro- posed , and , in spite of prolonged negotiations , the Trustees were unable to induce them to withdraw their objections ; and in the meantime the governors of the Victoria Infirmary , who had at first seemed ready cordially to support the Muirhead scheme , raised difficul- ties about guaranteeing the necessary facilities for women students , and soon made it evident that they were not disposed to give that scheme the support which would have made it a practicable one . In 1901 , when Queen Margaret College had been incor- porated as part of the University , the Trustees approached the University Court again , and after some conferences the University authorities intimated that they were will- ing to agree to a proposal similar to the first scheme of the trustees , by which the last two years of study should be provided for by the Muirhead Trustees at the Victoria Infirmary . A petition was , however , drawn up by the women medicals , expressing dissatisfaction with the pro- posed arrangement , and it was not carried out . A year or two later it was suggested that if the Muir- head Trustees were to contribute £ 10,000 towards the building fund of the Western Infirmary , one or two wards there would be open to women . This proposal was seriously entertained by the Trustees , but was ultimately rejected because the University Court would not bind themselves to open all the University classes to women students . In 1905 the governors of St. Mungo's College , which is an extra - mural medical school in connection with the Royal Infirmary , were contemplating a reorganization of that College , and at a conference of the governors and the Muirhead Trustees a new proposal was discussed . It was proposed that St. Mungo's College should be reconstituted as a " Muirhead College of St. Mungo , " to be a complete medical school , open to all students irre- spective of sex . The Muirhead Trustees would then , by assisting in the endowment and management of the new College , obtain valuable facilities for women , while St. Mungo's , thus strengthened , would be able to claim admission to the University as an Affiliated College . This scheme appeared hopeful , but was killed by the attitude of the Royal Infirmary managers , who would have none of it . Eventually , the present scheme was evolved , by the co - operation of the bodies named at the beginning of this article .

226 THE COMMON At the eleventh hour the managers of Victoria Infirmary intimated that they would oppose the scheme , at least , if they were not allowed a share of the Muirhead funds , and ultimately they made a proposal which if it had come earlier would probably have changed matters considerably . They offered a free site for a Muirhead College , and ample facilities for the clinical teaching of women students . But the Muirhead Trustees did not consider themselves at liberty to recede from the arrange- ments they had made , and the opposition of the Victoria managers was ineffectual . It is to be hoped that the new arrangements at the Royal Infirmary will be a step towards the complete removal of sex - disabilities as applied to women students . Reviews . THE WEEKLIES . The Christian Commonwealth , which always holds words of good cheer for the women , has in its issue of July 6th an excellent article on " Armchairs for Men or Votes for Women " signed A. W. P. The distinguished scholar who writes so sympathetically of the toil and suffering of the women has put his hand on the weak spot . Let our indolent brethren read and note their terrible responsibility . The Shield for July is an unusually Suffragist number . This journal , which exists in the interests of motherhood and the race , recognises how powerless men are to protect women , and how necessary it is to give women the means to protect themselves . A list of most useful addresses is given in this number , and Suffragists desirous of obtaining counsel and help in dealing with the many difficult cases of morality which present themselves are referred to these institutions as safe and trustworthy . The Nation of July 9th had an altogether admirable article on the Bill . It is commonly assumed that those who say women should be enfranchised now are " extremists " ; yet nothing could be more moderate or more cogent than the reasons and motives advanced in this article . In the Saturday Review of June 18th was a charming description of Duchesse de Montpensier , whom the writer characterises as a " noble Suffragette . " THE HEALTH OF THE NATIONS . Compiled from special reports of the National Councils of Women . ( London : Constable and Co. , Ltd. , 1910. Pp . 191. One shilling . ) The International Council of Women has just published under the title of " The Health of the Nations a small volume giving reports from various countries of the health conditions obtaining therein . The reports have been con- tributed by members of the National Councils of Women , and deal with Infant Mortality , School and Industrial Hygiene , the Condition of Workers , Housing and Tuberculosis . While many are interesting and set forth detailed informa- tion which would be almost impossible of access to the ordi- nary inquirer , the book certainly loses much usefulness from the unequal nature of the contributions and the absence of any summary of the whole body of information contained . This makes it very difficult to compare the results and to draw any general inferences . In some reports , statistical information is included ; in others it is not . The account of the care of infants in Italy , for example , is very startling , but the total absence of figures suggests that it is possibly some- what highly coloured . Again some reports deal with all the subjects of inquiry , and others do not , and the countries follow one another in neither alphabetical , geographical , nor any other intelligible order . Canada , for example , comes between U.S.A. and Germany , Argentina between France and Switzerland , and Norway between Hungary and Belgium . These shortcomings injure the usefulness of this publication , evidently the fruit of much time and trouble , as a book of reference , though to those who take a general interest in social progress , much of value will reward their patience . Dr. Ogilvie Gordon , who edits the volume , contributes an introduction telling the history of the International Council . One wishes she had exercised her rights as editor more harshly and condemned and rearranged the reports more ruthlessly . The tone of most of the book is very hopeful , and one hopes that the very rosy view given of the housing conditions in Great Britain will not lead the good - natured but easy - going public to believe that enough has been done . As a matter of fact , we are at the very beginning of reform here , and even with strenuous efforts it will be many years before more than the fringe of overcrowding and bad housing is even touched . A Correction . We regret that , in our issue of June 16th , a mistake occurred in the report of the Winchester Society . The correct notice was : Mrs. Walter Carey proposed Lady Shelley as Representative of the Winchester Society on the Federation . This was seconded by Mrs. Clowser and unanimously carried . Lady Shelley has consented to be the Representative .

EMIGRATION A " MAIN SOLUTION FOR EXCESS OF WOMEN . " To the Editor of " The Common Cause . " Madam , I notice in an account in your colums of a debate at Camberley that Miss Fothergill , in speaking in support of a resolution " That it is not desirable in the interests of the country or of women that the Parliamentary franchise should be granted to women , " brought in and advocated the emigration of women . It does not seem to have occurred to her that in order to make conditions better for ourselves at home , she proposes we should sacrifice part of our sex by help- ing some of them to spend their lives in colonies where against the interests of women they will have the privilege and duty of having a vote . But perhaps Miss Fothergill would safeguard these unfortunate beings fror so terrible a fate by prohibiting ( for " the interests C women " ) the emigration of women from the Motherland into any colony where women can vote . 33 I should like to commend this to the consideration of this lady and of any other Anti - Suffragists who are seeking to serve their generation by helping some of our best assets to attain such happy conditions of life as are denied to them at home . Preserve them , oh , ladies , from Charybdis whom you are anxious to drag out of Scylla ! Could you also realise with how much less danger to woman and to the country this question which appears to injure women's in- terest could be solved if the women could go as freely into the markets of the world with their labour as do the other half of our nations ! And I mean not alone the labour market , so called , but those other marts , where for the exercise of mental gifts in many ways , the right to some produce of the earth is acquired . And I contend there is only one key to that freedom , which is the vote your only legitimate control over laws , when properly used . As your enfranchisement is your strongest claim to a position digni- fied enough to serve the best interests of women . MARGARET O'SHEA . WOMEN IN INDIA . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , Of course , Anglo - Indians are likely to be acquainted with a picture of Indian women which is not altogether typical of them as a whole , because their know- ledge is gleaned to a great extent from missionaries , who naturally enough get into touch most readily with the pariah or outcast class of Hindus , and know comparatively little about the others . Nevertheless it would be difficult to prove that women of caste are treated better than their low - class sisters . " While agreeing with Miss Ransom about the lurid picture that might be written of England's iniquities , there are some points in her references to India which I cannot let pass un- challenged . Many girls are married in childhood - i.e . , irrevocably betrothed , " says Miss Ransom . As a matter of fact , it is the rule for them to be actually married at about 11 or 12 ; they often become mothers soon after . These facts are too well known to insist upon . " Hindus crown their What does women with the poetry of grace and beauty . " this mean ? I once asked a lady doctor of some experience as a medical missionary whether there ever existed in India any love between man and wife . She seemed to recall only one or two cases of it . Little girls are taken to doctors far less often than little boys , because as a rule natives do not think them equally worth troubling about or paying for . Miss Ransom says , in extenuation of their marriage system : " A marriage is scarcely ever arranged unless the horoscopes of both girl and boy agree , and promise a fair amount of harmony and happiness . " This method of ensur- ing matrimonial felicity can hardly appeal to us . Miss Ransom goes on to say that the women of India " read with great delight their own marvellous epics , some reading aloud while others sew or spin . " Now there are 38 million odd women in India . Not anything like a quarter of a million know how to read . There are 37 million women at the very least to whom this description could not possibly apply , even were these epics written in a modern language . When one remembers that the ancient language of the epics is to them something like what old High German or even Greek might be to us , one cannot but feel that Miss Ransom is picturing to herself rather the fanciful India of Lalla Rookh than a real India . As for the other side of the picture - the women sewing I have always understood that for Indian women to do needlework is a sign of emancipation . The beautiful embroidery that comes to us from India is , I believe , chiefly the work of men . It is the dherzi ( tailor ) who makes the

JULY 14 , 1910 . THE COMMON dresses of Anglo - Indian women . The ordinary Hindu woman does not seem to know how to put a pin in . << As for heathen " religions not existing in India , we should all , I am sure , like to know what Miss Ransom's definition of heathenism may be . All broad - minded people will admit the beauty and purity of Buddha's teaching , but it is admitted generally that Buddhism has practically died out in India . As for dancing girls not being honoured unless they deserve it , when does Miss Ransom consider that they deserve it . The following is an extract from Dubois : " Next to the sacrifices , the most important persons about the temples are the dancing girls , who call themselves devadasi , servants or slaves of the gods . Their profession requires of them to be open to the embraces of persons of all castes . They are bred to this profligate life from their infancy . The in- famous life to which the daughter is destined brings no dis- grace on the family . " - Yours , S. F. WARING . Latchford House , Warrington , June 25th , 1910 . WOMEN AND UNIVERSAL MILITARY HOME SERVICE . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , A few days ago I received an invitation to sign the petition for universal military home service . The object of this petition is to promote the principle that every able- bodied man shall undergo military training . The petition may be signed by " adults of either sex of 17 years and over . " It is not my desire to enter into the merits of this question as to whether men should or should not undergo military train- ing , but merely to draw the attention of your readers to the fact that women are being asked to give their opinion as to the adoption of this principle , and that so far no Anti- Suffragists have raised any objection to , or protested against , this intrusion of women in a matter in which women " take no practical part . " can It must be presumed that the opinion of women is invited on this particular question because such opinion would be taken seriously into consideration in regard to any future legislation , otherwise it would be futile to ask for it . Anti- Suffragists , however , tell us that any measure traceable to the votes of women - and votes are only opinions directly ex- pressed " would lack that physical sanction essential to the enforcement of law , " and any law popularly regarded " as woman - made might not only be treated with disregard and contempt , but would drag down respect for law in general . " The same arguments would necessarily apply against women signing this petition . It might conceivably obtain a large majority of women's signatures , and would consequently be regarded with contempt , and drag down respect for military training as one of those things which " only women " want . Yours , EDITH PALLISER . 26 , Pembroke Square , Kensington , July 4 , 1910 . THE DAILY PRESS AND THE SUFFRAGE . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , In view of the unfairness of the public press , and notably of the " Standard , " is it not time that Suffragists showed the daily papers that they cannot continue with im- punity alternately to besmirch and belittle our movement . Nothing will affect them but a notable drop in their circula- tion , and if members will agree to a general boycott of all dailies and weeklies which display the lieing spirit , they would probably begin to feel the effect disagreeably . It is of little use for a few women here and there to do this - it must be universal . We should miss our London daily , but the news of the world is sufficiently presented to us in such a friendly paper as the " Manchester Guardian , " and our own press will keep us conversant with the doings of the Anti- Suffragists .

MAKING WOMEN PAUPERS . To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , It is difficult to see what bearing Mr. Irvine's letter has on the point that a confinement is not an emergency . Were he a woman , what joy he would bring to the hearts of those who allege that those of the so - called " inferior sex incapable of engaging in argument by reason of their inability to keep to the point , their tendency to ignore their opponents ' 39 are

CAUSE . 227 statements , their pernicious habit of " jumping to con- clusions . " As it is , one can but think that Mr. St. John Irvine's definition of a poor man is a thing apart from and utterly opposed to that in ordinary acceptation , or else that , while preaching to others , he runs the risk of becoming him- self a castaway by staking his all in speculative measures of the " wild - cat variety . Probably , however , his view coincides with that of an in- sane patient who recently informed me that it didn't matter what meaning a word conveyed to other people so long as the speaker understood it , and who therefore made a point of calling all horses motors . One inclines the more to this belief when one reads of the sufferings of " the entirely sinless ratepayer . " Where is this rara avis to be found and does Mr. Irvine really think that the common variety escapes scot - free ? I don't . Had he taken the trouble to read the rest of the corre- spondence Mr. Irvine would have noticed that for the sake of the race I pleaded that all should have help ; that it is precisely because of a feeling of reverence for human life that I cannot sufficiently reprobate the teaching that its production is an emergency , following ( apparently ) unavoid- able self - gratification . By all means let these unfortunate mothers have assistance from public funds if necessary , but do not waste sympathy on the subject of making paupers of people who incur obligations they cannot fulfil . If they have to take money earned by others in this way they are paupers in fact if not in name . If the name acts as a deterrent so much the better . As to " restraint and responsibility , " surely poor and rich alike are capable of learning ; but they will hardly appreciate the benefits of such knowledge if they have been previously led to believe that the results of a lack of these qualities are emergencies , and are to be paid for after the manner of street accidents . As the sole object of my first letter was to make a protest , and as I have done this , I will not trespass further on your M. D. valuable space . - Yours , June 11 , 1910 . Mr. St. John Ervine writes again asserting that the lower birth - rate among well - to - do people compared to the poorest is not due to self - restraint , and he proceeds : - Now , about this " sins of the fathers " business ! To - day there is nothing about which men are less dogmatic than about the laws of heredity ! Medical men have assured Com- missions and Inter - departmental Committees that the great majority of children are born in the same state of health , and that it is only after birth that processes of differentiation , due to conditions of life , set in . Nature , in other words , has taken pains to give her children a fair start ; it is man , either through ignorance or pigheadedness , who imposes handicaps . The result of imposing these handicaps is to give us a criminal , weakly , debilitated race , ending its days either in gaol , the lunatic asylum , or prison . These places cost money . The people who die in them are so much waste . All of that waste could be avoided . Therefore , I repeat , it is " a fool's game to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children . " - Yours , ST . JOHN G. ERVINE . July 7 , 1910 . P.S. I forgot to add that the question of payment and saving for a great many - a very great many - working - class people is absolutely impossible ! Mrs. Cooke is , of course , a middle - class woman . I implore her to go into the first poor street she can find , and ask the people there precisely how much money they can afford to save out of their wages ! [ We could wish that Mr. Ervine , also , were a little less dog- matic about the " laws of heredity . " The world of scientific men seems at present divided into two camps - the one swearing that inheritance is all and environment naught , the other that environment is all - powerful , and can , indeed , make the silk purse of the sow's ear . Is it not likely that truth may lie mid - way ? As for provision : if a man has undertaken the responsibility of the birth of a child , which will cost from 2s . to 5s . a week after it is born , can he not afford to lay by 3d . or even 6d . a week for that child for six months before it is born ? Once the child is on the way someone should have the responsibility ; about that we are quite clear , and the mother as well as the child should be guarded and nurtured . - ED . " C.C.

To the Editor " The Common Cause . " Madam , There is an omission in the report , given in " The Common Cause " of July 7th , of the general meeting of the above Club to which I should like to draw attention , as it concerns an important recommendation to the committee . As a motion was not in order , a recommendation was proposed and seconded in form that the committee should take steps to provide that proxy votes should be admissible in the election of members of committee . The present regulation - that members of the Club must vote in person - obviously prevents most members outside London from having any part in such election or any control over the management and policy of the Club , although these include almost half the membership of the Club . The chairman , Mr. C. A. V. Conybeare , expressed much surprise that proxy votes or voting by letter in the election of the committee had not been provided for , its necessity being emphasised by the very small attendance of members present on the occasion . This regulation and others of a kind which might exist in a proprietary club are unsuitable to one entirely supported by the subscriptions of its members , as is the case of the Inter- national Women's Franchise Club . The statement that the locality of the new premises of the Club was " decided " upon in general meeting is also too strong , since no resolution on the point was either put to or adopted by the meeting . - Yours , Chenies Street Chambers , W.C.

Every effort is being made to get as many philanthropic and other bodies as possible to call meetings and pass resolutions in favour of the Bill , and to request that facilities will be granted for passing it into law . LONDON - BLACKHEATH . Two open - air meetings were held on June 21st , at which Miss Cockle and Miss Watson were the speakers . The crowds were most atten- tive , and the resolution was in each case carried , and afterwards sent to the Prime Minister . LONDON EALING AND ACTON . The open - air meeting which we held on the evening of June 27th on Haven Green proved such a success that at the close , we were asked to organize another very soon . Miss Cicely Corbett most kindly came down to speak , Mr. Kennedy took the chair , and Miss Gadsden , a local speaker , gained and kept the attention of her hearers in a way that makes us certain that her voice will be heard at other than Ealing meetings in the near future . The crowd which collected on a not very promising evening , and numbered about 150 , behaved throughout in an attentive and sympathetic manner . The rummage sale has had to be postponed until the early autumn . Will all members keep their contributions and try to add to them that it may be a great success . LONDON - EPSOM AND EWELL . Our fourth open - air meeting was held at the Clock Tower , Epsom , on Monday evening , June 27th , when Miss Palliser and Miss Janet Thomson were the speakers . In spite of the weather a good - sized crowd listened with close attention to their admirable speeches , and the audience was obviously a friendly one . On the afternoon of June 24th a drawing - room meeting was held at Ewell , at the house of Mrs. Moran . Mrs. Homan took the chair , and Miss Cicely Corbett was the speaker . The presence of several Anti - Suffragists added to the interest of the occasion , and Miss Corbett's spirited address was followed by some criticism , though her opponent declared that she was in entire agreement with Mrs. Homan's speech . The meeting closed with the oft - heard Anti - Suffragist cry , " Your arguments are so difficult to answer ! " Two new members were enrolled , and many present were glad to receive literature . LONDON - ESHER . We held two open - air meetings this week , one under the auspices of the Surbiton local branch in Kingston Market Place , and one of our own branch at the Fountain , East Molesey . Both meetings were held on Wednesday evening , June 29th . The speakers were Miss Cockle and Miss Ward , and at both meetings we carried a resolution in favour of the new Bill to be forwarded to the Prime Minister . The Market Place meeting , which had not been advertised , was small and orderly ; that at East Molesey , crowded and rather more excit- able . This meeting had been advertised by leaflets . We have every hope of getting up more open - air meetings at the end of July , as the attention shown by the audience was in both cases encouraging . LONDON - NORTH HACKNEY . Work has been quietly but steadily progressing since the General Election , when 1,300 signatures were obtained to the voters ' petition . Miss Palliser , Miss Hodge , and others addressed a meeting in the Library Hall , Stoke Newington , in April .

Lilly took the chair . Miss M. Hodge ( from Australia ) and Mr. Ed . Smith ( Men's League ) spoke , and were listened to by a very appreciative audience . A recitation by Miss Penelope Irwin , and a short Suffrage play by Miss Hodge , called " A Burning Question , " followed . There was some music and light refreshments . The room was full , many having to stand round the door . There were probably more than a hundred present . LONDON - WINDSOR AND ETON . The second monthly At Home was held in the Grove Road Club Room on Monday , June 27th . The chair was taken by Mrs. Nagel , " Women and a stirring address was given by Mrs. B. C. Everett on and Economics . " The speaker dealt fully with the reasons which compel women to undersell men in the labour market , and pleaded for equal wages for equal work . She showed how the vote would affect women wage - earners . The recent procession through London , in which Mrs. Everett took part , was described , and also the meeting at the Albert Hall which followed . A resolution in favour of Women's Suffrage was put by Mrs. Nagel , and carried unanimously . A vote of thanks was proposed by Miss Street , and seconded by Miss Young . The next At Home will be held in the same room on Monday , July 25th , when the speaker will be Miss H. D. Cockle , of the London Society . NEW FOREST . The annual general meeting of the above Society was held at Milton Hall on June 23rd . The chair was taken by Miss Clough ( vice- principal of Newnham College ) , and an address was given by Mrs. Stanbury . Both speakers supported Mr. Shackleton's Bill , and a resolution welcoming the Bill and demanding facilities for its passing into law was carried unanimously , and forwarded to the Prime Minister and the member for the constituency . Mrs. Stanbury's stimulating and witty address greatly interested her audience , and she has kindly offered to come and help us again in September , when we also hope to have our organizer , Miss Duncan , to work in our constituency . NORWOOD AND DISTRICT . In spite of showery weather a successful garden meeting was held at Anerley on June 30th . Miss Abadam delighted an enthusiastic audience , and the resolution in favour of facilities for the passing of the Representation of the People Bill , 1910 , was passed unani- mously , and has been sent to Mr. Asquith and Mr. Bonar Law . A cake - and - candy sale was held immediately after the meeting , and a rummage sale was held on Saturday . Both were in aid of the Nor- wood Society's Suffrage Shop Fund . A deputation of electors from Sydenham interviewed Major Coates , M.P. for Lewisham , on behalf of our Society , and obtained from him a promise that he would not oppose the Bill . We are now trying to arrange a deputation from Beckenham to Mr. Forster ( Sevenoaks ) and one to Sir Harry Samuel ( Norwood ) . Letters are also being sent by individual electors . SHREWSBURY . By the kindness of Mrs. Harold Cock , a meeting was held at Kingsland House on Thursday , June 30th . Mrs. Harley presided , and Miss Eleanor Rathbone gave an address , full of interesting informa- tion , on the work of the Conciliation Committee and Mr. Shackleton's Bill . Much interest was aroused when Miss Rathbone spoke of her experiences as one of the National Union deputation to Mr. Asquith . " Common Causes " and badges sold well , and it is hoped that many new members will join the Shropshire Society as a result of this meeting . THREE TOWNS AND DISTRICT . In view of the present crisis the Three Towns Society is distribut- ing bills and pamphlets and holding meetings . Dr. and Mrs. Jaques have kindly invited members and friends to an At Home on Monday , July 4th , to awaken interest and to plan further organization . On Thursday the Women's Liberal Association have agreed to hold a meeting in their hall , Cornwall Chambers , when Suffragists will address the meeting , and unitedly endeavour to advance matters by practically demonstrating to Mr. Asquith and members of the House their feelings at this juncture . The Drake's Circus Hall is taken for Friday , July 8th . Miss Frances Stirling , of the National Union , and others will speak , and Dr. Rosa Bale will preside . WALLASEY AND WIRRAL . In spite of a rather cold , inclement night the above Society held an open - air meeting on New Brighton Sands . Mr. Ward Platt , C.C. , J.P. , took the chair , and Mrs. Allan Bright addressed an interested and attentive crowd . A resolution urging the Government to grant facilities for the Conciliation Bill to be passed this session was passed with one dissentient . A few " Common Causes " were sold , and literature was distributed . WEST BROMWICH . The first quarterly meeting of the West Bromwich Branch of the National Union was held on June 29th in the Library Lecture Room . Mrs. Harry Brockhouse was in the chair , and there were between sixty and seventy present . Miss E. M. Gardner , B.A. , gave an interesting address , dealing chiefly with Mr. Shackleton's Bill , and proposed a resolution , which was carried ( with one dissentient ) , urging the Government to grant facilities for the passing of the Bill into law .

A drawing - room meeting was held at Winscombe on June 13th in support of the Representation of the People Bill , 1910. A resolution in favour of the Bill was passed , and copies sent to the Prime Minister , to the local political associations , and to our member , who , although not in favour of Women's Suffrage , has subsequently promised not to oppose the Bill . A delegate was appointed to attend the Council meetings at Bristol . It is almost impossible for country members to attend the demon- stration in Trafalgar Square on the 9th owing to the distance from Bristol . One , however , hopes to do so by making a very special effort . BIRKENHEAD AND DISTRICT . Mr. A series of open - air meetings was held in our area from June 27 to July 1 , three taking place in the villages of Heswall , Little Sutton , and Neston , respectively , and two in Birkenhead . Ziegler , Mrs. Allan Bright , and Mrs. Cooper also spoke at the largest meeting in our town . Mrs. Cooper was the prime mover and speaker at all these gatherings , and , as usual , appealed strongly to her audiences on each occasion by her oratory and sound common - sense . Few dissentients were to be found against the resolution in favour of the Bill . Unhappily , the weather was very bad most of the time , and in consequence intended meetings at the gates of works in the dinner - hour had to be abandoned . BRADFORD . A drawing - room meeting was held at 5 , Ashfield , on Wednesday , July 6. The host and hostess were Rev. H. and Mrs. McLaren . Mrs. Gray Heald was the speaker , and Rev. H. McLachlan took the chair . A resolution was passed unanimously calling upon the Government to pass the long - delayed Bill of justice to women . Four new members were enrolled . A collection was taken on behalf of the expenses of those attending the demonstration in Trafalgar Square on July 9. The response was most satisfactory . On Friday , July 8 , there was an afternoon meeting at Rossefield School , through the kindness of Miss Gregson and Miss Rendall . Mrs. T. R. Hill was in the chair , and Mrs. Gray Heald was the speaker . The resolution was passed unanimously . Two new members were enrolled . Again the audience was kindly responsive to the collection for demonstration expenses . Twenty - six members attended the demonstration , and journeyed with the Leeds contingent . HASLEMERE . Our garden fête took place on July 2nd , and was a great success . In bright sunshine people began to arrive , and at 3.30 the chairs and surrounding lawns were crowded . The show opened with some Old English dances performed by six or eight children , who danced with real enjoyment . Then followed the Suffrage play , " A Change of Tenants . " acted by Miss Blanche Smith , Mr. Rex Chauden , and Mr. Iolo Williams ( the son of Mr. Aneurin Williams ) . Mr. Johnston Forbes - Robertson then made a thrilling speech which was listened to with deep attention by the large audience . Tea was served out of doors at a charge of sixpence , and as all the provisions had been given the takings were clear profit . The second half of the entertainment opened with more dances , and then Mrs. Tobias Matthay was to recite , but , rain having begun to fall , all the chairs were carried indoors ,, and in a wonderfully short time the audience had arranged themselves in the big drawing - room and listened for nearly half an hour to Mrs. Matthay , who recited beautifully . The evening audience was now arriving , and for them dances and a farce were performed out of doors ; then , another shower having begun , the jumble sale , which was under cover , was opened , and after that they were all invited indoors to see a second performance of " A Change of Tenants . " It was nearly nine o'clock when the proceedings closed , having begun at 3 p.m. Everyone had Scotch Tweed COSTUMES 3 1/2 ( MADE TO ORDER ) , Correctly fitted and beautifully tailored . GUINEAS .

230 THE COMMON worked with a will , and all gave their services , including the men who kept the gates and moved the chairs . We paid no fees , and quantities of goods had been given us to sell , as well as all the cakes , etc. , for the tea . The rain interfered a little with the sales , but still a brisk business was done at the stalls , and we have made , w think , almost £ 40 , and we are still selling off privately what was left over . We hope one result of our fête will be that a large contingent will go up from here to take part in the demonstration in Trafalgar Square next Saturday . HASTINGS AND ST . LEONARDS . By kind invitation of Mrs. Harlow Phibbs , a very successful garden party was held on the 2nd at Helensdene . Miss Alice Bullock gave an interesting explanation of the new Bill , and then dealt with some of the most often quoted objections to Women's Suffrage . Mrs. Strickland gave a most convincing address , showing how greatly the economic position of women would be improved by the vote , and concluded with an earnest appeal to our members and friends to be present at the demonstration on the 9th . Mrs. Harlow Phibbs ' recitation , " Woman This and Woman That , " by Kipling , was much appreciated ; also a short Suffrage duologue in which Miss Young and Miss Stanham took part . The sale of literature was kindly undertaken by Miss M. Saddler and Miss L. Page , with most encouraging results . HORSHAM . As a result of the meeting at Horsham Park on June 29 , a branch Society has now been formed of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies , in the Surrey , Sussex and Hants Federation , Mrs. Hurst being chairman and Mrs. Keatinge undertaking , pro tem . , to be hon . secretary . At their first Committee meeting on July 6 it Members of Parliament for Surrey , was decided that all and Hants Sussex should to , be written asking them if and unable to Bill , support the Conciliation to do so to abstain from voting against it , and this has been done . An open - air meeting took place in the Carfax on Friday evening , July 8 , which was very well attended , Sir Eustace Piers , Bart . , pre- siding . Mrs. Stanbury and Miss Barbara Duncan both made very able speeches to an attentive audience . LONDON - EALING AND ACTON . Our branch was represented in the demonstration in Trafalgar Square on July 9. A contingent went up from Ealing , and three Miss Cufson banners waved aloft connected with our branch . very kindly presented our Society with a new banner for the demon- stration , inscribed , " Ealing , " and " Constitutional . " " Madame Curie , " in shades of gold , mounted on bamboo sticks , again did service , and the London Society on a red banner had inscribed the name of " Ealing , " and the 1,600 signatures we had obtained at election time . LONDON - HAMPSTEAD . A successful drawing - room meeting was held by kind permission of Mrs. Park at 92 , Fellows Road , on July 5. Miss Clementina Black Miss Emily was in the chair , and Miss Margery Corbett spoke . Davies proposed a resolution urging M.P.s to be in their places to vote for the Conciliation Bill . This was seconded by Mrs. Maitland , and a copy of the resolution has been sent to all M.P.s resident in Hampstead . A series of open - air meetings is being held on Thursdays at 8 p.m. on Hampstead Heath . Miss Helen Ward , Miss Speedwell Black , and Miss Clementina Black spoke at the first of these meetings . Miss Ward proposed a resolution , which was passed by a large majority , asking for an early date for the second reading of the Conciliation Bill . This was sent to the Prime Minister . The weather was most Miss Thomson unfavourable for our second meeting on June 30 . made some introductory remarks and Mrs. Rogers spoke , and then the rain began . As the crowd seemed ready for more , in spite of the weather , Miss Cicely Corbett , who had come to speak , moved to a place where the audience had some shelter , and stood out in the open herself in a perfect downpour and spoke for about an hour . Many questions were asked , and at least one hundred people remained the whole time . Several copies of " The Common Cause were sold . Not much better luck attended the third meeting on the 7th , when Miss I. O. Ford and Mrs. Stanbury came to speak , but our speakers were not daunted by the weather , and they had quite a good meeting , lasting about an hour and a half , with much discussion at the end , in which Miss Clementina Black joined . A meeting is to be held at the Library , Prince Arthur Road , on the 19th , 4-6 p.m. , which it is hoped all our members will attend and bring friends . Invitations are being sent out , and particulars as to speakers will be announced in " The Common Cause . " LONDON - HIGHGATE . Acting on Miss Frances Sterling's suggestion that even the Vice- President of the Anti - Suffrage League might be approached and reminded that over two thousand of his constituents had signed our voters ' petition , the Rev. T. A. Lacey , M.A. , kindly undertook to introduce a deputation to the Earl of Ronaldshay . The interview took place on Thursday July 7 , and lasted a full hour , Lord Ronaldshay giving all the speakers a most courteous hearing . A more enthusias- tic and whole - hearted advocate than Mr. Lacey could not have been found , and his arguments were admirably supplemented by the two Chancery barristers and other electors who followed him . The points subsequently raised by Lord Ronaldshay were also effectively dealt with , and the general impression of the deputation was that though he was probably already pledged with regard to his action towards the Conciliation Bill , yet his opposition was less pronounced than formerly , and that the interview had been undoubtedly helpful . They also felt that Lord Ronaldshay wished the issue to be faced in a straightforward manner , and would resist any attempt to shirk a division . LONDON NORTH HACKNEY . Since we sent our last report seven new members have joined the Society . The three Members for the Parliamentary divisions of Hackney Sir Albert Spicer ( on the Conciliation Committee ) , Mr. Raymond Greene , and Mr. Bottomley ( an Adult Suffragist ) , have all promised to vote for the second reading of the Women Occupiers ' Bill . LONDON SOUTH KENSINGTON . An open - air meeting was held on the evening of July 8 in King Street , High Street , Kensington , the audience being addressed by Miss Dawson and Miss I. O. Ford . Miss Dawson spoke upon the general aspect of the Women's Suffrage movement , and Miss I. Q.

CAUSE . JULY 14 , 1910 . Ford laid particular stress upon the need of the vote for working women . Leaflets were distributed and " Common Causes " sold by helpers , to whom the thanks of the South Kensington Committee are due for rendering the meeting so successful . NORTH OF ENGLAND . When one is doing most one has the least time to report one's doings . We came back from Bristol to plunge straight into Between preparations for the Trafalgar Square demonstration .. Monday and Friday 250 people gave in their names for the special train . This represents no small amount of devotion , for many of our members are poor and nearly all are very busy folk , to whom an expenditure of some 13s . and the sacrifice of a whole day were no small matter . Of course , with more time we could have got four times the number . The party included midwives , trades unionists , working men and women , co - operators , elementary and secondary teachers , and professional women ; only a small proportion of the 250 were not earning their living in one way or another . When one knew what some of our people had given up , the ignorant accusation of the exasperated Anti - Suffragist ( " You are paid to do this by rich women ! " ) had its sad humour . The special train was very gay with decorations , the engine- driver , stoker and guard all sporting the colours , and the carriage windows all being placarded , " Great Suffrage Demonstration . " Women's Our printer nobly took charge of the banners , and though all of us were not in time to carry them , a contingent arrived in time to bear off the old North of England banner with its date of over forty years ago . In addition to two of the Society's banners , our branches carried banners from Bolton , Blackpool , Knutsford , and Radcliffe . We had twelve petition banners inscribed with figures over 2,000 , and twenty - five decorative shields with appropriate mottos , such as , 66 Deal Effectively with Our Bill , " " Who Are the People ? " " The North Supports the Bill , " etc. Manchester was well placarded with great posters saying " Pass the Bill ! " ( We again have to hold over some of the reports of Societies . ) JULY 14 .
